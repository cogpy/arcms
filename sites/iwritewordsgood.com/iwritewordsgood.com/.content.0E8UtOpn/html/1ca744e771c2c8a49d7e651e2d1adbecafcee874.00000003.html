        <p class="patternlanguage">We now start that part of the language which gives shape to groups of buildings, and individual buildings, on the land, in three dimensions. These are the patterns which can be <span class="italic">designed</span> or <span class="italic">built</span>- the patterns which define the individual buildings and the space between buildings; where we are dealing f or the first time with patterns that are under the control of individuals or small groups of individuals, who are able to build the patterns all at once.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage">The first group of patterns helps to lay out the overall arrangement of a group of buildings: the height and number of these buildings, the entrances to the site, main parking areas and lines of movement through the complex.</p>
        <p class="italic"><img src="images/threedots.gif" width="181" height="56"></p>
        <p class="patternlanguage">We assume, based on the instructions in <span class="italic">Summary of the Language</span>, that you have already constructed a sequence of patterns. We shall now go through a step-by-step procedure for building this sequence into a design.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">1.</span> The basic instruction is this: take the patterns in the order of sequence, one by one, and let the form grow from the fusion of these patterns, the site, and your own instincts.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">2.</span> It is essential to work on the site, where the project is to be built; inside the room that is to be remodeled; on the land where the building is to go up; and so forth. And as far as possible, work with the people that are actually going to use the place when it is finished: if you are the user, all the better. But, above all, work on the site, stay on the site, <span class="italic">let the site tell you its secrets</span>.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">3.</span> Remember too, that the form will grow gradually as you go through the sequence, beginning as something very loose and amorphous, gradually becoming more and more complicated, more refined and more differentiated, more finished. Don't rush this process. Don't give the form more order than it needs to meet the patterns and the conditions of the site, each step of the way. In effect, as you build each pattern into the design, you will experience a single gestalt that is gradually becoming more and more coherent.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">4.</span> Take one pattern at a time. Open the page to the first one and read it again. The pattern statement describes the ways in which other patterns either influence this pattern or are influenced by it. <span class="italic">For now</span>, this information is useful only in so far as it helps you to envision <span class="italic">the one pattern before you, as a whole</span>.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">5.</span> Now try to imagine how, on your particular site, you can establish this pattern. Stand on the site with your eyes closed. Imagine how things might be if the pattern as you understood it, had suddenly sprung up there overnight. Once you have an image of how it might be, walk about the site, pacing out approximate areas, marking the walls, using string and cardboard, and putting stakes in the ground, or loose stones, to mark the important corners.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">6.</span> Complete your thought about this pattern, before you go on to the next one. This means you must treat the pattern as an &quot;entity&quot;; and try to conceive of this entity, entire and whole, before you start creating any other patterns.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">7.</span> The sequence of the language will guarantee that you will not have to make enormous changes which cancel out your earlier decisions. Instead, the changes you make will get smaller and smaller, as you build in more and more patterns, like a series of progressive refinements, until you have a complete design.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">8.</span> Since you are building up your design, one pattern at a time, it is essential to keep your design as fluid as possible, while you go from pattern to pattern. As you use the patterns, one after another, you will find that you keep needing to adjust your design to accommodate new patterns. It is important that you do this in a loose, relaxed way, without getting the design more fixed than necessary, and without being afraid to make changes. The design can change as it needs to, so long as you maintain the essential relationships and characteristics which earlier patterns have prescribed. You will see that it is possible to keep these essentials constant, and still make minor changes in the design. S you include each new pattern, you readjust the total gestalt of your design to bring it into line with the pattern you are working on.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">9.</span> While you are imagining how to establish one pattern, consider the other patterns listed with it. Some are larger. Some are smaller. For the larger ones, try to see how they can one day be present in the areas you are now working on, and ask yourself how the pattern you are now building can contribute to the repair or formation of these larger patterns.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">10.</span> For the smaller ones, make sure your conception of the main pattern will allow you to make these smaller patterns within it later. It will probably be helpful if you try to decide roughly how you are going to build these smaller patterns in, when you come to them.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">11.</span> Keep track of the area from the very beginning so that you are always reasonably close to something you can actually afford. We have had many experiences in which people try to design their own houses or other buildings, and then get discouraged because the final cost is too high, and they have to go back and change it.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage">To do this, decide on a budget and use a reasonable average square foot cost to translate this budget into square feet construction. Say for the sake of argument that you have a budget of $30,000 for construction. With help from builders, find out what kind of building you are making. For example, in 1976 in California, a reasonable house, compatible with the patterns in the last part of the language can be built for $28/ square foot. If you want expensive finishes it will be more. With $36,000 for construction, this will give you some 1300 square feet.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">12.</span> Now throughout the design process, keep this 1300-square-foot figure in mind. If you go to two stories, keep the ground area to 650 square feet. If you use only part of the upstairs volume, the ground floor can go as high as 800 to 900 square feet. If you decide to build rather elaborate outdoor rooms, walls, trellises, reduce the indoor area to make up for these outdoor costs - perhaps down to 1100 or 1200. And each time you use a pattern to differentiate the layout of your building further, keep this total area in mind, so that you do not ever allow yourself to go beyond your budget.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="header2">13.</span> Finally, make the essential points and lines which are needed to fix the pattern on the site with bricks, sticks or stakes. Try not to design on paper; even in the case of complicated buildings find a way to make your marks on the site.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage">More detailed instructions and detailed examples of the design process in action, are given in chapters 20, 21 and 22 of The Timeless Way of Building.</p>
