        <p>. . . in a public building, or an office where there are many people coming in, <a href="apl080.htm" class="header2">Self-Governing Workshops and Offices (80)</a>, <a href="apl081.htm" class="header2">Small Services Without Red Tape (81)</a>, <a href="apl091.htm" class="header2">Traveler's Inn (91)</a>, <a href="apl146.htm" class="header2">Flexible Office Space (146)</a> - the place inside the <a href="apl130.htm" class="header2">Entrance Room (130)</a> plays an essential role; it must be built from the very start with the right atmosphere. This pattern was originally proposed by Clyde Dorsett of the National Institute of Mental Health, in a program for community mental health clinics.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/threedots.gif" width="181" height="56"></p>
        <p class="header2">Have you ever walked into a public building and been processed by the receptionist as if you were a package?</p>
        <p>To make a person feel at ease, you must do the same for him as you would do to welcome him to your home; go toward him, greet him, offer him a chair, offer him some food and drink, and take his coat.</p>
        <p>In most institutions the person arriving has to go toward the receptionist; the receptionist remains passive and offers nothing. To be welcoming the receptionist must initiate the action - come forward and greet the person, offer a chair, food, a seat by the fire, coffee. Since it is first impressions which count, this whole atmosphere should be the first thing a person encounters.</p>
        <p>A beautiful example we know is the reception desk at Browns Hotel in London. You pass into the hotel through a small, unassuming entrance, not unlike the entrance to a house. You pass through two or three rooms; then come to the central room in which there are two old writing desks. The receptionist comes forward from an inner office, invites you to sit down in a com fortable chair at one of these writing desks, and sits down with you while you fill out the hotel register.</p>
        <p>The reasons most reception areas fail completely to have this quality, is that the receptionist's desk forms a barrier, so that the desk and equipment together help to create an institutional atmosphere, quite at odds with the feeling of welcome.</p>
        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <p><span class="header2">Arrange a series of welcoming things immediately inside the entrance - soft chairs, a fireplace, food, coffee. Place the reception desk so that it is not between the receptionist and the welcoming area, but to one side at an angle - so that she, or he, can get up and walk toward the people who come in, greet them, and then invite them to sit down</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp; <img src="../images/threedots.gif" width="181" height="56"></p>
        <p>Place the fireplace most carefully, to be a focus - <a href="apl181.htm" class="header2">The Fire (181)</a> give the receptionist a workspace where she can be comfortable in her own work, and still make visitors feel welcome <a href="apl183.htm" class="header2">Workspace Enclosure (183)</a>; give the space <a href="apl159.htm" class="header2">Light on Two Sides (159)</a>; perhaps put in an alcove or a window seat for people who are waiting - <a href="apl150.htm" class="header2">A Place to Wait (150)</a>, <a href="apl179.htm" class="header2">Alcoves (179)</a>, <a href="apl180.htm" class="header2">Window Place (180)</a>. Make sure that the reception point itself is lighter than surrounding areas - <a href="apl135.htm" class="header2">Tapestry of Light and Dark (135)</a>. And for the shape of the reception space start with <a href="apl191.htm" class="header2">The Shape of Indoor Space (191)</a>. . . .</p>
