        <p>. . . this pattern helps to complete the work of <a href="apl159.htm" class="header2">Light on Two Sides of Every Room (159)</a>, by going even further to reduce glare; and it helps to shape the <a href="apl225.htm" class="header2">Frames as Thickened Edges (225)</a>.</p>

        <p class="header2">Windows with a sharp edge where the frame meets the wall create harsh, blinding glare, and make the rooms they serve uncomfortable.</p>
        <p>They have the same effect as the bright headlights of an oncoming car: the glare prevents you from seeing anything else on the road because your eye cannot simultaneously adapt to the bright headlights and to the darkness of the roadway. just so, a window is always much brighter than an interior wall; and the walls tend to be darkest next to the window's edge. The difference in brightness between the bright window and the dark wall around it also causes glare.</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <table width="100" border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="0">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="../images/223diagram2.gif" width="200" height="98"></td>
          </tr>
          <tr>
            <td><i class="italic">Glare . . . and no glare.</i></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p align="left">To solve this problem, the edge of the window must be splayed, by making a reveal between the window and the wall. The splayed reveal then creates a transition area - a zone of intermediate brightness - between the brightness of, the window and the darkness of the wall. If the reveal is deep enough and the angle just right, the glare will vanish altogether.</p>
        <p>But the reveal must be quite deep, and the angle of the splay quite marked. In empirical studies of glare, Hopkinson and Petherbridge have found: (1) that the larger the reveal is, the less glare there is; (2) the reveal functions best, when its brightness is just halfway between the brightness of the window and the brightness of the wall. ("Discomfort Glare and the Lighting of Buildings," <i>Transactions of the Illuminating Engineering Society,</i> Vol. XV, No. 2, 1950, pp. 58-59.)</p>
        <p>Our own experiments show that this happens most nearly, when the reveal lies at between 50 and 60 degrees to the plane of the window; though, of course, the angle will vary with local conditions. And, to satisfy the need for a "large" reveal, we have found that the reveal itself must be a good 10 to 12 inches wide.</p>
        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <p class="header2">Make the window frame a deep, splayed edge: about a foot wide and splayed at about 50 to 60 degrees to the plane of the window, so that the gentle gradient of daylight gives a smooth transition between the light of the window and the dark of the inner wall.</p>

        <p>Build the depth of the frame so that it is continuous with the structure of the walls - <a href="apl225.htm" class="header2">Frames as Thickened Edges (225)</a>; if the wall is thin, make up the necessary depth for the reveal on the inside face of the wall, with bookshelves, closets or other <a href="apl197.htm" class="header2">Thick Walls (197)</a>; embellish the edge of the window even further, to make light even softer, with lace work, tracery, and climbing plants - <a href="apl238.htm" class="header2">Filtered Light (238)</a>, <a href="apl240.htm" class="header2">Half-Inch Trim (240)</a>, <a href="apl246.htm" class="header2">Climbing Plants (246)</a>. . . .</p>
