        <p>. . . suppose the main spots of the garden have been defined - <a href="apl163.htm" class="header2">Outdoor Room (163)</a>, <a href="apl171.htm" class="header2">Tree Places (171)</a>, <a href="apl175.htm" class="header2">Greenhouse (175)</a>, <a href="apl170.htm" class="header2">Fruit Trees (170)</a>. Now, where there is a special need to emphasize a path - <a href="apl120.htm" class="header2">Paths and Goals (120)</a> - or, even more important, where the edges between two parts of a garden need to be marked without making a wall, an open trellised walk which can enclose space, is required. Above all, these trellised walks help to form the <a href="apl106.htm" class="header2">Positive Outdoor Spaces (106)</a> in a garden or a park; and may perhaps help to form an <a href="apl112.htm" class="header2">Entrance Transition (112)</a>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p class="header2"><img src="../images/threedots.gif" width="181" height="56"></p>
        <p class="header2">Trellised walks have their own special beauty. They are so unique, so different from other ways of shaping a path, that they are almost archetypal.</p>
        <p>In <a href="apl121.htm" class="header2">Path Shape (121)</a>, we have described the need for outdoor paths to have a shape, like rooms. In <a href="apl106.htm" class="header2">Positive Outdoor Space (106)</a>, we have explained the need for larger outdoor areas to have positive shape. A trellised walk does both. It makes it possible to implement both these patterns at the same time - simply and elegantly. But it does it in such a fundamental way that we have decided to treat it as a separate pattern; and we shall try to define the places where a trellised structure over a path is appropriate.</p>
        <p>1. Use it to emphasize the path it covers, and to set off one part of the path as a special section of a longer path in order to make it an especially nice and inviting place to walk.</p>
        <p><img src="../images/174photo2.1.jpg" width="393" height="279"><img src="../images/174photo2.2.jpg" width="200" height="141"></p>
        <p><i>A trellis gives shape to an outdoor area.</i></p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>2. Since the trellised path creates enclosure around the spaces which it bounds, use it to create a virtual wall to define an outdoor space. For example, a trellised walk can form an enormous outdoor room by surrounding, or partially surrounding, a garden.</p>
        <p>Therefore:</p>
        <p><span class="header2">Where paths need special protection or where they need some intimacy, build a trellis over the path and plant it with climbing flowers. Use the trellis to help shape the outdoor spaces on either side of it.</span></p>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p><img src="../images/threedots.gif" width="181" height="56"></p>
        <p>Think about the columns that support the trellis as themselves capable of creating places - seats, bird feeders - <a href="apl226.htm" class="header2">Column Places (226)</a>. Pave the path with loosely set stones - <a href="apl247.htm" class="header2">Paving With Cracks Between the Stones (247)</a> - Use climbing plants and a fine trellis work to create the special quality of soft, filtered light underneath the trellis - <a href="apl238.htm" class="header2">Filtered Light (238)</a>, <a href="apl246.htm" class="header2">Climbing Plants (246)</a>. . . .</p>
