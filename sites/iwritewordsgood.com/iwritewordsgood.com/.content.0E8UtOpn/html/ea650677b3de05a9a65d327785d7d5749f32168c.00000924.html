        <p class="italic">&quot;People say, A Pattern Language changes their lives, by which I think they mean it changes the way they physically organize their lives... What Alexander and his co-authors set out to do was collect and organize the elements that make buildings loved, that make buildings 'live'. Freed from modernity, they teased out the deep-dwelling 'pattern language' that people understand buildings with... Every year some 10,000 copies of this $50 biblical tome are bought, and the number increases yearly.&quot;</p>

        <p class="patternlanguage">A Pattern Language is a philosophy of the human use of space and an analysis of what makes humans comfortable in the space they inhabit - city streets, public areas or private rooms.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage">Each pattern starts out with a design challenge, such as:</p>
        <p><a href="patterns/apl003.htm" target="mainFrame"><span class="italic">3 City Country Fingers**</span></a> <span class="italic">&quot;Continuous sprawling urbanization destroys life, and makes cities unbearable. But the sheer size of cities is also valuable and potent.&quot;</span></p>

        <p class="patternlanguage">The patterns explore the problem in depth and then state a solution, linking to preceding and concluding patterns that relate to the subject at hand.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage">You and your neighbors can use it as a tool to improve your neighborhood, an individual can use it to design a home or office, and it can also function as a guide in the process of construction.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage">Reading A Pattern Language changed the way I look at the world. It's the one book I won't loan to friends, but creating a website made sharing easy. Its linked hierarchy of patterns made it perfect for linking, and clicking from pattern to pattern is more efficient than flipping pages. The web also allowed me to index its 1100 pages. Copyright issues are a concern, so the site is obscured from search engines and shared only with friends and as part of my portfolio.</p>

        <span class="header2">4.</span> Proceed in this fashion, bookmarking patterns, until you've fleshed out the details for your project. You can adjust the sequence by adding your own material where you haven't found a corresponding pattern and change patterns where you have a truer or more relevant version.

In these cases they believe it would be wise to treat the pattern with some disrespect and seek out variants, since there are probably ranges of solutions which are not covered by what has been written.</p>
        <p class="patternlanguage"><span class="patternlanguage"><a href="hierarchies0.htm" class="header2" target="leftFrame">Patterns without asterisks</a> The authors are certain that they have not succeeded in defining a true invariant - and on the contrary there are certainly different ways of solving the problem. In these cases they have still stated a solution to provide the reader with at least one way of solving the problem - but finding the true invariant which lies at the heart of all possible solutions to this problem remains undone.</span></p>
