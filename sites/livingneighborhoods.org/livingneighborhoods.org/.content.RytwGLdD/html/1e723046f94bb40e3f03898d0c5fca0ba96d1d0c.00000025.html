It is not enough to simply identify these beautiful spots. What happens in a typical green-field development is that people see these beautiful places, then rush to exploit them, or overlook them, and perhaps even bulldoze them. In the city the problem is even greater. There are precious places, and spots which have magic in them - but these are burdened especially in the most recently built areas, by such utter disregard for the naturally occurring wholeness, that it is extremely difficult to imagine how to bring it back to order. Yet these urban examples, no less than nature, are no less our obligation. They need to be deeply transformed to make the ugly constructions of the 20th century, beautiful.</span>

This is intended to preserve a continuity from the city as it was, or the land as it was, to the neighborhood and buildings as they will be, and, through its unfolding, to maintain the deep feeling of the place at all times.</span>

This is the vital difference between what is proposed on this website, and the current conventional ways of thinking about architecture and planning. A "latent" center is a center that has the promise of life, even though it may not be very good, and we draw the inspiration of the large from that which is latent in the present. Only that way can we overcome our egotism, and reach real beauty.</span>
