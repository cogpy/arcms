        <p><span class="h4class" valign="top">When a generative code is used, the order in which things are done plays a decisive role in proper execution of the unfolding process. For example:</span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="h4class" valign="top">Roads and driveways must be located and built <b>after</b> the pedestrian structure, not before.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" valign="top">Roads must be located and built <b>after</b> the houses, not before.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" valign="top">Sewers must be located and laid <b>after</b> public space is created, not before.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" valign="top">When houses are designed, the garden must be placed (located) <b>before</b> the house volume is located, not after.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" valign="top">Construction work must begin <b>long before</b> final drawings are ready, and the drawings develop, in parallel with the construction process.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" valign="top">Windows must be placed, designed, and measured and built, after the walls or wall framing has begun, so that they reflect the real situations in the room, its light, and view.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" valign="top">According to contract, changes of design which have no effect on <b>quantity</b> of units built, <b>must not be</b> viewed as change orders, but as part of the builders obligation, provided they stay within parameters of quantity and price.<br>
          <br></span></li>
          <p><span class="h4class" valign="top">In an unfolding sequence, these things occur (of necessity) in this unusual order, not in the order we are used to. The changes of sequence are not whimsical, but necessary, to make sure that each thing can be adapted to the whole, in a successful fashion. They are necessary, in order to allow a coherent unfolding, of the neighborhood, where the right things come first, and the lesser ones take their place in the context provided by the major things. The "right" things, are the ones which have the biggest impact on the environment from a human and emotional point of view which is capable of making people healthy because their deepest feelings are respected.</span></p>
          <p><span class="h4class" valign="top">In order to see the contrast, we may refer to the order in which these things were usually done in conventional 20th-century development work.</span> <span class="h4class">In current practice, there are many conventions of sequence, which have become part of the accepted wisdom, in planning, architecture, and development. For example:</span></p>
          <li><span class="h4class">CONVENTIONALLY: Roads are built before the buildings they serve.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class">CONVENTIONALLY: In a tract development, street sewers are laid long before the houses are built.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class">CONVENTIONALLY: Houses are placed, and the garden is whatever is left on the lot, comes second.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class">CONVENTIONALLY: Windows are designed and positioned at the time the building's plans are submitted for plan check.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class">CONVENTIONALLY: Drawings are completed before any construction work is done.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class">CONVENTIONALLY: Neighborhood plans are completed, before any construction work is done.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class">CONVENTIONALLY: Public spaces are designed after individual buildings.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class">CONVENTIONALLY: Changes are done by change orders, and therefore become very expensive.</span></li>
