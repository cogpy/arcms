What is currently dreamed of and spoken about and carried out is hardly a beginning. It is simply an extension of the technocratic society we find ourselves in, not what it pretends to be. I find this quite upsetting. I think sustainability has become more and more of a buzz word. Everybody wants to get on the bandwagon by saying that what they’re doing is sustainable. And even at the best of times, what it means is using certain kinds of products and materials while leaving the social, ecological and emotional structure largely unchanged. Maybe that’s not quite so with regard to ecology. There are efforts being made there to deal more seriously with wetlands and forests and so forth, but it’s so much one little thing at a time, completely missing the larger context of life on earth.</span></b></p>

Any serious treatment of sustainability would have to deal with money flow. Although you occasionally see it referred to in the literature, people who are touting sustainability as the hallmark of their big new development projects have not carefully considered how prevailing financial systems compromise these efforts, and they may well not wish to.</span></b></p>

This was, of course, perfectly reasonable: trying to get energy from the natural circumstances of the earth rather than having to burn up non-renewable resources. Very, very sensible as an idea, but what was the consequence of it?</span></b></p>

That’s arguable: maybe the high cost was OK because that’s just the first stage in the development of a new idea. But the form these panels took were very rigid pre-fabricated panels which crucified the roofs of the buildings they were put on. First of all they are incredibly ugly, a significant issue in itself, which ought to be addressed within the boundaries of sustainability but isn’t. More important, they interfere grossly with adaptation. In other words, the more high tech the panels and materials are, the less possible it is to fine tune the shape, geometry, slope, modifications and extent of any given roof that they are put in. Suddenly you’ve got the very ugly and biologically dangerous phenomenon of the part driving the whole, rather than vice versa, wherever those roofs are built. However, it became a social statement –<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> if you were “with it,” you had to have solar panels.</span></b></p>

In the sustainability movement, though, people at the forefront are still talking about high tech solar panels, only these are bigger and better and more expensive and more rigid. That kind of earth is not a sustainable earth. This is incredible to me: they don’t understand that they are being co-opted by the very thing they view as the enemy, and that people in a world-wide movement of this sophistication can be so short-sighted. That’s just a cameo of what I object to about sustainability as it is practiced today.</span></b></p>

The<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> project, that I had some small role as an adviser to, began by saying that this was going to be the first massively wonderful demonstration of sustainability from soup to nuts. They had incredible aims including the idea of economic sustainability which was sophisticated. This is one of the first times that I know of where it was really being thought of seriously. But when it came down to it, the idealists who created this company put the company in the hands of people who were not idealists. They just didn’t understand sustainability as an idea, in my view. They began thinking about around 1200 houses or dwellings. Instead of considering the land and working out, from the point of view of the land, how to distribute these dwellings so that people had a natural relationship to land, to small town agriculture, to the natural flow of water on the land, to the naturally beautiful sacred spots on the land, and so forth, instead it was absolutely business as usual. They wanted to “preserve the land” in some pointless fashion, and then build all the buildings close together entirely for economic reasons, though they pretended that it was for architectural reasons. They handed the whole thing over to large-scale developers to try to work out what would have become simply another big post-modern bunch of buildings tied together on the land, pretending to be like an Italian hill town, but not in the least bit like an Italian hill town.</span></b></p>

The first thing I did when I visited was to spend a day walking about on the land. The director/originator of the project, to my astonishment, said he had never walked about on the land before to that extent. It’s not a very big bit of land. He was amazed by what I pointed out that needed to be protected and repaired. Every few hundred feet, I’d talk about that in detail. I said a proper plan, that has respect for the earth and nature, needs to weave what is built <i>into</i> what must be protected in the land itself. He acquiesced completely with his lips and in his actions did nothing about it – forgot about it virtually as soon as it had been discussed.</span></b></p>

The one thing which I believe they were doing correctly in that project, at least in part, was the issue of wetlands. They were being very careful to protect the small riparian area on that land. It just so happens that wetlands and the ecology of riparian areas is something that can be studied from a purely technical point of view. Therefore it’s OK to introduce it. All of the things that I observed on the land and showed them – this little level spot is a wonderful place to put a building, this piece of land just next to it is a wonderful place to leave absolutely alone, etc. – which I did yard by yard, was<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> completely inaccessible to the technical discussion that revolves around wetlands. Therefore it had no place in the sustainable plan as all those wise and intelligent people saw it. Again, this illustrates how extremely narrow, and often quite wrong headed, the sustainability movement is. That kind of thing can once again be co-opted even though it has a sound moral and scientific basis. Wetlands encompass I would say about 3 or 4 percent of what is important about land. But because wetlands happened to be the bit they could technologize, that’s the bit that found its way into their plan.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span></span></b></p>

You cannot start from a technological base like that and expect to get anywhere sensible. Such a base doesn’t have anything to do with the human heart. It doesn’t have anything to do, really, with the precious nature of the land. It violates by its very definitions the right kind of relationship between buildings and land in which the sacred nature of both is preserved and protectable.</span></b></p>

We had an evening together. I explained what it was like to build houses so that they had a real relationship to one another and to the land they were on, and how I would do that by working with them, in small groups and individually, to place each house with care. The emerging neighborhood they themselves would essentially fashion by walking on the land and choosing spots. Some of them were very moved by this approach, which was then presented to the hierarchy of this organization, who again ignored it completely. The enthusiasm that people had felt was essentially whacked on the head. This was reported by several disappointed people who called me afterwards. What I was talking about was a form of organization of construction where people had the ability to find their spot on the land the way a cat finds its spot in a room when it wants to go to sleep. That ability was offered to every household, every family, every individual. In a realistic and practical way, that can be done without increasing the cost of houses, and without increasing the cost of infrastructure. This is a social revolution because it creates genuine fibers of connection between people, human groups, community and the land.</span></b></p>

Such a developer has no model of operating to make it possible to do this. The models exist. They’re feasible. They’re cheap. But they don’t fit into the current models of sustainability. The sustainability movement, as far as I know, has not attempted to grapple with these models or to point the way to making the huge changes that must gradually be made.</span></b></p>

I agree that many of the people in the room were moved, including myself. There were also people who intended to build homes at Fairview who raised the technical issues almost immediately. “Will you use composting toilets? You haven’t mentioned that. What about solar energy? You haven’t mentioned that.” It’s so easy for us to land on the technology aspects of sustainability without looking inside ourselves to find what we long for, which leads to the emotional connection that you mentioned. I’ve now learned something about this because we’re here at Meadow Lodge (West Sussex, England), and I feel an emotional connection to this land.

Of course this place that we’re sitting in has been here for a long time. This particular bit of land is not now so different from the way it has been for about a thousand years. What happens during a long period of time like that, if things are being taken care of, is that the sanctity of every hedge, hummock in the land, fence post, and chestnut tree is cherished. A relationship of respect between the person and the hedge develops. You don’t necessarily do very spectacular things, but gradually that respect makes itself felt in ecology and sustenance and surroundings of the hedge, and then the hedge plays the respect back to you so you feel it in your bones. You feel love for the hedge and you feel well- being in yourself because you have that relationship with that hedge. If you multiply what I just said by 10,000 in a place like this, you have a massive connection to the land which can only really be achieved in that way.</span></b></p>

There something quaint -- annoyingly quaint -- about it. In buildings, for example, which is my profession, I’m not generally very interested in using ancient techniques of construction because, for very good reasons, ancient techniques are not consistent with the state and emerging state of our society. I think they cannot be. One reason is simply labor cost. It used to be the case 1000 years ago and 500 years ago that labor was typically about one tenth of the cost of a building. When a building was built, only 10% went to pay labor and 90% went to pay for the materials. Under those conditions where labor is that cheap, you can do all kinds of things that are labor intensive and it’s not a problem. A few decades ago labor cost – just taking a very rough average – was about 60% of the cost of the building. Introducing labor intensive methods, let’s say of laying out stone walls, cannot be done in the way it was done in ancient times. You can very carefully isolate a few operations which are so labor critical –<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> where the human touch must be there – as long as it is within the budget of a particular building or development project or neighborhood.

In fact on the contrary, I try to use high speed techniques to save labor so as to permit more time for making subtle decisions. That’s a very different approach.

It fundamentally does not work. It has a very expensive up-front cost. It’s intended to save money for the developer in the long run, but actually it’s a very expensive way to do it. More significant, it’s putting things first that are not first. I mean no one in their right mind thinks that a sewer is the most important thing in a community.

Those places are essentially pedestrian. The proper way to start a development like that is to settle the pedestrian places by reference to the land first.

And then put cars, trucks, ambulances and fire equipment in second place, not in first place. Then say, OK, how can we now move cars, park them, and allow emergency vehicles access in such a way as not to violate that precious thing that has already been established? This is a huge change. If you talk to a conventional developer about this, they just about fly off the handle because it challenges everything they know. What it does from the start is create a solid relationship between human emotion, concern, respect, and healing, to use your word, and puts the cars in second place. We all love our cars and benefit from them; the economy benefits from them. Our access to people not within bicycling distance is colossal and most people wouldn’t give it up for anything. I’m not advocating removing cars or reducing their role. I’m simply saying their role is vital, but it must be kept in balance.

If I go from the way you were describing what ecosystem is, to the idea that belonging is the first thing, then I’m looking at a system I’m part of and my assumption is that everything belongs here. The task isn’t to describe an ecosystem that’s different from me. The task is to understand how everything that belongs here fits together, including me.</span></b></p>

It certainly describes me. I’m part of a system that I don’t like, and I know it. I’m trying to figure out how I behave differently in that system to influence it in a direction that seems to be better, though I don’t understand an lot of what’s going on or how to influence it, or what’s good and what’s bad. My intuition is still telling me to do whatever I can do, and that’s one of the ways it’s easy to fall into technological traps. For instance, I can recycle if I learn enough about how to recycle well. At least I’m doing <i>something</i>. Basically, the need – the longing – to do something to move toward healing, not only the system I belong to but also myself, finds forms that I can grapple with. That’s one of the reasons we end up in that trap. Suppose you say to me, You belong in this town or this neighborhood or this house, and I try to grapple with what to do. What direction does that give me? If I let myself live in that question for a while, I do get answers that don’t come to me from technological solutions, green building, or various latest and greatest sustainability initiatives. It becomes <i>extremely</i> personal. And doing that –<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> allowing myself to live in that question -- also puts me in touch with the ache I have, the sadness I have, because I am a part of this system, and it needs –<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> I need – healing so desperately. I wouldn’t want to overlook that part of what’s going on in people who care about sustainability. I think that is a huge motivation, and also worthy of acknowledgment.</span></b></p>

My point throughout what we’ve been speaking about here is that exactly: the mismatch between the inner knowledge, or longing or intuition, about how things are and ought to be, compared with the models and tools that people have grasped at like straws in the hope that these straws will save us from drowning. My point is simply, so long as the tools are of the type that exist at the moment, they will not save us. That frustration you are describing and that sadness, almost desperation of sadness I would say, will continue unless these models are replaced. The fact that such models are possible is very important. As long as a person does not know that good models are possible, that person will grasp at, as you say, green building, solar panels, or wetland flows, as ways of satisfying that inner yearning. It’s the only kind of model currently available so you’d be stupid to pass it up. It’s better than nothing, or seems that way. I’m not sure it is. But if, as a result of just reading this conversation, people begin to see that there might be a model of a different kind that covers the territory in a unifying way, which leads directly to the human heart and is linked to the human heart, it doesn’t pretend not to be in order to get credibility in science (which isn’t going to give it credibility for very much longer if I am any judge), if they see models that are capable of going that much deeper and reconnecting them to the earth, not in this mechanistic fashion, but in terms of inner knowledge of who they are, then they will be much quicker to say, I don’t want to hear about green buildings anymore unless it is expressed in this way. Or even as sensible as it is to talk about fish and water birds and riparian areas, they might say, I don’t want to hear about it anymore unless it is directly connected to what I feel about those things when I’m there, and what my part is in them. Then you have the chance to really change the world, and by definition, it will be something that can’t be co-opted. If it has its anchor in the individual human heart and that commonality of feeling that we all experience at that level about these matters, it would be very, very difficult to co-opt it.</span></b></p>

I think that’s the way <i>The Nature of Order</i> can help redirect our energies, because its purpose is to show us how to generate life. The terrain is vast. There are so many things that each individual could choose to do. It’s hard for me to imagine what that looks like in motion on a grand scale. But at least for now it’s a way for me to double check myself about my assumptions. Do the solutions that have been put forth in the last 15 to 20 years contribute in that way? If they don’t, they are highly suspect.</span></b></p>
