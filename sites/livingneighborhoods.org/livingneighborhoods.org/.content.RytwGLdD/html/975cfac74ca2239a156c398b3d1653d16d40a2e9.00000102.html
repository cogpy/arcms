        <p><span class="h4class">Sometimes you just do not know the people who are likely to live and work in a new neighborhood, because it is too early, or too hard, to identify them. Even in this case, it is helpful -- almost necessary -- to involve people who are living and working nearby, and treat them as a source of information, and inspiration, so that what you are doing becomes as real as possible, even in the temporary absence of some of your future occupants.</span></p>

Spend time on the land where you imagine this project can be done. Visit the place fairly often. Involve your partners in continuing conversation about the place and its value. Make sure that you gradually achieve cohesion as a group by being on the land together, and continuing to talk.<br>
        (b) A piece of land is not yet identified. People have an idea of what they want to do but haven't yet found a piece of land where they feel it's appropriate to do what they have in mind.

        How much park and green space would you like to see?<br>
        How much in the way of gardens?<br>

How they fit together may not be immediately obvious and may be hard to talk about, but it is important to do so. How will it work economically? How will it work socially? Given your choices of the above ingredients, you also need to answer the key question How <b>much</b> of each is going to be happening there?</span></p>
        <p><span class="h4class">Later these ingredients, may be refined to become patterns, and then steps of the generative code.</span><br></p>
