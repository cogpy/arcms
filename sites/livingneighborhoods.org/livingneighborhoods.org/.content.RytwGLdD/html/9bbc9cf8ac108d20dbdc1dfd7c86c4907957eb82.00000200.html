We hope very much that you approve of the changed format, navigation, and functional priorities that are set in the new menu. If you want to comment, please write to us. Positive and negative feedback are equally useful.</span>
        <p><span style="font-family:arial;color:black;font-size:13px">The email address to write to is at the bottom of the WELCOME page. You will find additions of new material and further changes almost every day, as we continue to rebuild the site.</span></p>

        <p><span style="font-family:arial;color:black;font-size:13px">If you have shortcuts on your computer to specific pages of our website, and if they were made more than a week ago, they are now working only through a slightly cumbersome redirect mechanism. It will be better for you, and for us, if you reset them, from the pages you are interested in, so you can then point directly to the new system of addresses inside the site.</span></p>
