        <p>What is precious, and where is it? What is ugly? What is desperately in need of repair? What has the potential to become something wonderful, with a minimum of work? We find it most helpful to do this with a map in one hand and a pen in the other. -- a surveyor's drawing of the site, with the boundary marked, with trees and existing buildings marked, recognizable features so that you can locate yourself as you are walking around and know exactly where you are.</p>
        <p>Identify special spots in the land that must be enhanced and protected. Determine needed density by considering what the land can hold comfortably -- not based on how to make the most money, but how to hold the land as sacred in perpetuity. In any case, as a preparation for making a generative code for a particular place, it is essential to make a diagnosis of the place. This is a record of all beautiful and important spots, all places in need of repair, all views and view corridors, all those important trees and buildings, gullies, edges, which are <b>especially</b> vital to the heritage and spirit of the place.</p>
        <p>Mark all these places on the map and write down what they are. Use an arrow for important views. a dotted line for a natural path that it is natural to follow. Remember this is a working document. It is very vital information, and you should hold on to it, and store it in a safe place. Keep working on it, over subsequent visits and walks.</p>
        <p>This diagnosis is the well-spring of the life that can arise in the new neighborhood. It is the source of inspiration that connects you to the land.</p>

        <ul>
          <li>You know that this tree is important, to the feeling of the place.</li>
          <li>You know that a view through between these buildings is important, and fills you with feeling when you are standing there.</li>
          <li>Even though it seems trivial, you know that the sunshine which falls in a certain circle, is what draws people, and needs to be kept (if possible) in any future neighborhood.</li>
          <li>You know that this old brick wall, with jasmine growing on it, even though it is leaning, and moss covered, is a valuable part of the past, and should, if at all possible, be kept.</li>
        </ul>All this together is an approximation to <span style="color:blue"><b>the structure</b></span> of the land.
