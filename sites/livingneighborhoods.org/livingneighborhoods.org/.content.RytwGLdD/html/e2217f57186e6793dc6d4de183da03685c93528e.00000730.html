        <span class="h4class" style="color:black">One of the best ways to see clearly, or to find out what your vision is, is to close your eyes, and imagine that you have just arrived in the place. What do you see? What is most wonderful about the place you see?</span>
        <p><span class="h4class" style="color:black">It is also very possible to do the closed eyes process with your friends. Just sit around, all close your eyes together, and talk about what you see.</span></p>
        <p><span class="h4class" style="color:black">Write down what you see. It is sometimes elusive, and if you don't write it down the memory can fade.</span></p>

        <span class="h4class">What we mean by "partners" are any of the people who are likely to do this project together. They may be lay people, neighbors, professionals, city people, and anyone who has an important part to play, to get the project done. It will take a while to identify these people as a group. Allowing it to form gradually will help the process.</span>
        <p><span class="h4class">Sometimes you just do not know the people who are likely to live and work in a new neighborhood, because it is too early, or too hard, to identify them. Even in this case, it is helpful -- almost necessary -- to involve people who are living and working nearby, and treat them as a source of information, and inspiration, so that what you are doing becomes as real as possible, even in the temporary absence of some of your future occupants.</span></p>

        <span class="h4class">Two different scenarios:<br>
        (a) A piece of land is already identified. People have a piece of land and have an idea of what they want to do there. Walk the land together. Spend time on the land where you imagine this project can be done. Visit the place fairly often. Involve your partners in continuing conversation about the place and its value. Make sure that you gradually achieve cohesion as a group by being on the land together, and continuing to talk.<br>
        (b) A piece of land is not yet identified. People have an idea of what they want to do but haven't yet found a piece of land where they feel it's appropriate to do what they have in mind. Even then you can begin thinking about the ingredients of the community, and what will be unique to this place.</span>

        <span class="h4class">Given the piece of land, what are some of the ingredients you are thinking about putting there?<br>
        Is it a conventional group of houses?<br>
        Can it contain businesses and workplaces?<br>
        How much park and green space would you like to see?<br>
        How much in the way of gardens?<br>
        Would you like something communal -- church, town hall, association? This last is very important -- but it needs an inventive attitude and time to think of a communal building that will really work.</span>
        <p><span class="h4class">The <b>overall mix</b> of things should be inventive, and particular to <b>you</b>. How they fit together may not be immediately obvious and may be hard to talk about, but it is important to do so. How will it work economically? How will it work socially? Given your choices of the above ingredients, you also need to answer the key question How <b>much</b> of each is going to be happening there?</span></p>
        <p><span class="h4class">Later these ingredients, may be refined to become patterns, and then steps of the generative code.</span></p>

Your neighborhood will be a more lively place, in the long run people are likely to love it more. And there is probably more chance of it helping to make the world a better place.</span>
