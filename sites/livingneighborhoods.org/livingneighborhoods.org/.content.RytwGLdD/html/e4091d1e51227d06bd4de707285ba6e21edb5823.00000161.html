            <p><span class="h4class">Be careful in your thinking. Of course it is not true that ANY set of five rules will be able to to generate large and beautiful larger wholes that are well-fitted to the land. The rules we choose as generative rules, must have profound properties -- and a special kind of coherence -- so that they do work together, simply, to generate successful, well-adapted large scale configurations.</span></p>
            <p><span class="h4class">To study these profound properties is a very complicated business, and we must be respectful of it. It is at least as complicated, in its way, as the science of morphogenesis and the process which allows living form to appear when an embryo is formed. We do not need to start thinking about this problem just yet. For the time being, let us stay with our simple, and down-to-earth picture. But if we want to go deeper, and reflect on the depth of this great problem, we cannot do better than read a few words by the great biologist Lewis Wolpert, where we shall begin to understand the deeper aspects of what generative codes are, and what they need to do.</span></p>

            <p><span class="h4class">"The embryo contains a generative rather than a descriptive program. All the information for embryonic development is contained within a fertilized egg. So how is this information interpreted to give rise to an embryo? One possibility is that the structure of the organism is somehow encoded as a descriptive program in the genome. Does the DNA contain a full description of the organism to which it will give rise? The answer is no. The genome contains instead a program of instructions for making the organism—a generative program—in which the cytoplasmic constituents of eggs and cells are essential players along with the genes like the DNA coding for the sequence of amino acids in a protein.</span></p>
            <p><span class="h4class">"A descriptive program, like a blueprint or a plan, describes an object in some detail, whereas a generative program describes how to make an object. For the same object the programs are very different. Consider origami, the art of paper folding. By folding a piece of paper in various directions, it is quite easy to make a paper hat or a bird from a single sheet. To describe in any detail the final form of the paper with the complex relationships between its parts is really very difficult, and not of much help in explaining how to achieve it. Much more useful and easier to formulate are instructions on how to fold the paper. The reason for this is that simple instructions about folding have complex spatial consequences. In development, gene action similarly sets in motion a sequence of events that can bring about profound changes in the embryo. One can thus think of the genetic information in the fertilized egg as equivalent to the folding instructions in origami: both contain a generative program for making a particular structure."</span></p>
