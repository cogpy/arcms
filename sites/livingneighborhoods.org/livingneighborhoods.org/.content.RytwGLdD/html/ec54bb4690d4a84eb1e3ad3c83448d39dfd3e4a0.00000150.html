        <span class="h404class">PROJECT HISTORY</span> <span class="h4class"><span class="h4class">The Fresno market is on a prominent city block in Fresno, California, at the intersection of Shaw and Blackstone. The block is 800 feet by 600 feet.</span></span>
        <p><span class="h4class">The first market building, which we built about 20 years ago, forms the core of the 12-acre site, and will be the core of the commercial buildings that are built around it. We began work on plans for the whole market area about 20 years ago, and, at Richard's request, first built the structure to house the main market. It is an arched timber structure on concrete block piers, 120 feet long, and 40 feet wide. Richard set to work and planted vines all over it, and they now provide a leafy shade. Fresno can be very, very hot.</span></p>
        <p><span class="h4class">Not long after we built the market, Richard moved his mother's old house from downtown Fresno, and put it on blocks to the west of the structure. See the map below.</span></p>
        <p><span class="h4class"></span></p>

          <span class="caption">An early sketch map of how the commercial, shops, and workshops might grow around the Farmer's market as their focus. The market structure is visible in the middle of the drawing. Three buildings around the edge, have been standing there, from the time before we started. The remaining buildings shown on this sketch are hypothetical, simply to allow us to get a grasp on where this neighborhood would go, and how it might become lively and beautiful. This plan, like all such plans,is now quite obsolete, and is being replaced by a generative code. (See below).</span></span>
        </align>
        <p>Once the market was built, Richard began to explore his life-long dream to create a city block in modern ,urban California, that was able to preserve, and encourage, the human community, the mutual respect, the informal way of living, and the importance of human relations and friendliness. Many times during the ensuing years he expressed frustration with the deadly "development game" and its pressure to replace flesh and blood with plastic, but he has hung in their, never losing sight of this dream.</p>

These tiles were cast on the ground with a blue pigment in the mix. To save money they were dropped into the slab, the same afternoon we cast the slab, when the concrete had been screeded off, and was setting up, just stif enough to support the tiles, and still plastic enough to let the tile sink in just the right amount. The technique generated a pleasant unevenness in the tiled surface.</span></span></p>

        <span class="h4class" style="color:blue">Richard's aim has always been to build something truly beautiful -- a place for community, and vivid life, as much as a place of commerce. In the course of his work, he is constantly having to juggle tenants, keep them happy, try to meet their requests, even knowing that this tenant will want this and such, while the next tenant who comes will very likely want something else. Needs for parking, built space, entrances, visibility from the highway, all change continuously. No conventional form of "design" can solve these problems successfully.</span>
        <p><span class="h4class" style="color:blue">The more we have worked on the problem, we have arrived at the notion that the key ingredients are, in this order:<b></b></span></p>
        <ul>
          <li><span class="h4class" style="color:blue"><b>A fundamental use of trellised, leafy structures, most likely arched, smaller than the main farmer's market, but providing the pedestrian "streets" of the shopping center.</b></span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" style="color:blue"><b>These trellised structures will run along as-yet unknown paths, all over the site.</b></span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" style="color:blue"><b>The trellises should form a very approximate grid -- not a rigid grid, but a "soft" grid which can go where it needs, and yet give people an easy way to navigate the site.</b></span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" style="color:blue"><b>Off the trellised walks, there will be buildings, often free-standing, with gardens between them, forming a kind of checkerboard of green space and buildings, and encouraging the friendly informal life Richard wants to support for his customers and clients.</b></span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" style="color:blue"><b>Some of the buildings will have roofed open arcades on their edges, which connect with the trellised paths, together forming the overall pedestrian network.</b></span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" style="color:blue"><b>Some small parking lots will be allowed to appear between the buildings, but the total area of these parking areas will never exceed 25% of the site area. Further parking will be provided underground.</b></span></li>
          <li><span class="h4class" style="color:blue"><b>There will be a single road which does pass through the site, and which will perhaps serve a hotel to be built in the back (north-west) corner of the site. Richard visualizes this road as lined by carnival-like lights strung back and forth overhead, above the road.</b></span></li>
        </ul>
