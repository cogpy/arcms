            <div id="text1-6">
              <p>To do this you MUST stand in the room itself. Do not try to do it from a plan.</p>
              <p>Stand in the room where your new office is going to be. Try to see where the NATURAL centers are. Natural centers are places which have an obvious presence as a "place" in the room. They are the places which have the greatest potential for life: in some cases you will see them as the places which have the most life as they are right now.</p>
              <p>On the scale drawing of your space, sketch in these natural centers as they presently exist.</p>

            <div id="text1-7" style="width: 45%;">
              <p>Now you must try to get clear about what will be most important in your office.</p>
              <p>What will make it easy for you to work here? What makes it unique to you? What is it that will make this your office as opposed to someone else's?</p>
              <p>You need to invent the types of centers, unique to you, that will make you comfortable.</p>
              <p>As a first step in this work, write down the activities which are most important in your work day:</p>
              <p><span style="font-style: italic">Talking to people, Using desk, Filing and storage, Computer use, Conference, Working with clients, Discussion, Reading, Writing by hand, Concentration, Using library, Telephoning, Access to records, Overview of projects, Other machines (FAX, Scan, etc), Walking about, Reading memos, Connection with your staff, Drawing and layout, Working with one other person.</span></p>
              <p>Underline items from the list, or write others down by hand.</p>
            </div>

              <span style="color: #bbf">STEP 6:</span>
              <p>NOW DREAM: DREAM ABOUT YOUR IDEAL WORKING CONDITIONS AND TURN THEM INTO TWO OR THREE MAJOR PATTERNS</p>
            </div>
            <div id="text1-8">
              <p>Now do your best to visualize each of your working activities as a pattern or ideal center.</p>
              <p>For each activity on your list, ask yourself which occasion you can remember where this particular kind of activity was most inspiring for you. Do not stick to stereotypes. Be honest with yourself about which occasion you can remember where this activity was really most inspired and most helpful to you in your work.</p>
              <p>The result may be quite surprising.</p>
              <p>A DREAM ACTIVITY AS A CENTER. Once you get a positive vision of the dream condition for each activity, write down the essential physical elements that made it happen.</p>
              <p>Make a list of the two or three most important patterns which will make your office just right. For reference in later steps of this sequence, call them Pattern A, Pattern B, etc.</p>

              <p>You may now prepare to marry the patterns you have defined for your activities, with the pre-existing natural centers in the room.</p>
              <p>During the steps that follow, in each step you will put down one feature of the office, and establish the existence of one bit of additional structure in the room.</p>
              <p>As you go forward, each step should get you closer to an overall system of space in which every part is useful, living, coherent, and positive for your work.</p><a href="/sequences/otherinfo/officelayoutedit.htm"><span style="color: #e3e5c9">CONTINUE ON TO READ A PAPER WHICH EXPLAINS IN DEPTH, WITH PATTERNS, THE PROCESS OF OFFICE LAYOUT</span></a>
