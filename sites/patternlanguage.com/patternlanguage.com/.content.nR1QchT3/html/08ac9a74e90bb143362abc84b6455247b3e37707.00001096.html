        Here are the key points:
        <ul>
          <li>We intend to maintain a database of builders capable of carrying out projects, all over the US.</li>
          <li>Hopefully represented in every part of the US.</li>
          <li>Ultimately represented in every part of the world.</li>
        </ul>Reasons why a builder would want to join the network:
        <ul>
          <li>The idea is that builders will get clients by being in the network</li>
          <li>they will get to do better work, (hopefully) by working with us, guiding them.</li>
          <li>They will also get access to special contracts, and learn how to use them.</li>
          <li>They will also, as a result of using these contracts, have a chance to build with more spirit, and more freedom, than is normally possible, thus making a building which is a more true work of art and heart.</li>
        </ul>Benefits to Users
        <ul>
          <li>Users can get local help and support from capable professionals who understand our methods of working</li>
          <li>Users can get help in realizing their dreams</li>
          <li>They can get someone who will build from rather simple sketches, thus making communication more direct, and avoiding the errors inherent in a system where architects have to "interpret" the users wishes, merely because user cannot provide instructions needed by convention, in a form directly usable by the builder</li>
          <li>Users will also have the huge benefit of a local person, with whom they can enjoy face to face work , discussion, and modification of ideas.</li>
        </ul>Benefits to Pl.com.
        <ul>
          <li>This will give us a chance to help people, and make the dream of user-designed houses more operational and realistic</li>
          <li>it will bring us the benefits of a network of people discussing and improving the methods we are trying to spread</li>
          <li>it will give us income to maintain the website</li>
          <li>it will increase the validity and public perception of what we are all trying to do</li>
        </ul>If you are interested in getting information about our proposals for this network, please e mail us, and we will send you information. Please include a fax number or a mailing address.
