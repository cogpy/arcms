You may have experienced it in your grandparents' farmhouse or an old bungalow you shared in college. It makes you feel comfortable, but it transcends physical comfort. It pleases the eye, but it runs deeper than mere beauty. It feels natural, but it is also intensely human. You associate it with old places and old buildings, but it is more than mere nostalgia. It is that timeless relationship of forms and spaces that human beings intuitively respond to, that human cultures have produced with the same innate sureness with which birds build their nests. It is what makes a place--and the people who dwell in it--feel alive.</i></h2><i></i><br>

                <p>Christopher Alexander calls this "the quality without a name," and he has devoted his long career as an architect, builder, teacher, author, and theorist to learning what it is made of and how to make more of it.</p>
                <p>"I started in the late 1950s to try to understand why it was that people in traditional societies did so well--better than us--at everything to do with building," Alexander says. That inquiry led to studies in a village in India, a PhD in architecture from Harvard, and a series of books that have become essential texts to many architects and builders. At the base of all this work is Alexander's conviction that the quality that he seeks is not subjective, that there are concrete principles that shape built environments that truly succeed.</p>
                <p>In his most famous book, A Pattern Language, Alexander and his co-authors identify and explain some 250 interrelated models, or patterns, by which to organize every level of human habitation, from regions, towns, and neighborhoods to buildings, rooms, alcoves, and trim. By presenting the patterns in descending order of scale and cross-linking each pattern to related patterns, the book provides sequences by which designers and builders can create such work. Based on the authors' observations of places they viewed as especially alive, and buttressed with extensive references to social science research, the book makes a run at answering the most fundamental question in construction: What makes a good building?</p>
                <p>More than 20 years after the book's publication some of the patterns, such as "South Facing Outdoors," now seem self-evident. Others, such as "Farmhouse Kitchen," have been incorporated into the mainstream of custom building (in this case as the great room). Still others, such as Site Repair--the concept of building on the worst part of a site in order to leave the best spots intact--stand as ideals for designers to aspire to.</p>
                <p>Rick Schwolsky, now editor of Tools of the Trade magazine, encountered Alexander's work when he was a custom builder in Vermont. "I came across A Pattern Language at a time in my building career when I was trying to move into design/build," he says. Handed the book by an architect friend, Schwolsky remembers responding immediately. "It puts into words what people who are designing or building have a sense of intuitively," he says. "It's like he cracked the code."</p>
                <p>Schwolsky later attended a week-long workshop with Alexander, where he was exposed to some of the thinking behind the book. "Where he came from was trying to get us to believe, which I do, that good design is not subjective," he says. It responds, in Schwolsky's words, to "humble human needs. I don't think that building design has to be a trip away from human need."</p>
                <p>The century just past, however, saw architecture take just such a trip. Modernism overthrew the tradition-based Beaux Arts curriculum in most architecture schools. Mass-produced housing supplanted folk architecture. Automobile-oriented land planning unraveled the fabric of community life. The unnamed quality that had guided builders for untold centuries quietly withered.</p>
                <p>Berkeley, Calif., architect Max Jacobson, who contributed to A Pattern Language in the 1970s, remembers the climate of the time. "The modern movement was in full force," he says. The result was architecture he calls "Pretty cold--pretty mean actually, pretty uncompromising--not a very gentle architecture. Buildings didn't look good or function well. Windows didn't open." The counterculture responded with an earthy but unschooled style of building that Jacobson terms the "woodbutcher approach. It was those two poles." A Pattern Language, he says, "was a way to make sense out of that dichotomy."</p>
                <p>Like the woodbutchers, Jacobson says, "We were responding against what we thought was inhuman architecture." But under Alexander, who had studied mathematics before he became an architect, the authors took a rigorous, empirical approach to what seemed a purely subjective matter: "Let's face squarely what makes a good building, what makes a beautiful building, what makes life worth living." In studying existing examples of successful buildings they found that they could indeed identify universal principles. "There was a way to do a door, an entry to a room, a yard."</p>
                <p>It was an audacious project--to demystify and make plain the essential building blocks of humane design. But in hindsight the effort, which recognized the profound effects of the built environment on human lives, makes perfect sense. Buildings can heighten or diminish people's physical and emotional well-being, enhance or degrade their relationships. They are the soil we grow in. Studying the results of trial-and-error experiments by millennia of builders was like studying the output of gardens to find the combination of soil, sunlight, and rain that make a garden grow best.</p>
                <p>Some architects still dismiss the work as a mere cookbook that ignores the architect's creative role, but others have embraced it with a fervor. Among the latter is Sarah Susanka, the author of The Not So Big House, which acknowledged Alexander and his co-authors for providing what she called "the most appropriate way to think about architectural design, buildings, and the people who inhabit them." A Pattern Language also provided a strong, if seldom acknowledged, theoretical and practical basis for the New Urbanism. Gary Coates, a professor of architecture at Kansas State University who uses the book in both his courses and his practice, calls it, "one of the most important books in architecture in the last 500 years."</p>
                <p>Far from Alexander's last word on the subject--his long-awaited book The Nature of Order is near publication--A Pattern Language still represents the core of his philosophy of building. Still actively designing and building according the principles in the book, Alexander is now working on patternlanguage.com, a website that will make the work more accessible to builders, architects, and homeowners.</p>
                <p>For architects and builders new to A Pattern Language, Alexander notes that there are several ways to work with the book. The simplest is to use it as a source of ideas or as a check on existing designs. One can very easily satisfy the functional requirements of a house without including features whose function is to delight: an Outdoor Room, Sunny Counter, Alcoves, a Staircase as a Stage. "The more these things are present in a building the more comfortable it will be, the more satisfactory to the people who use it," Alexander says.</p>
                <p>Professionals may also share the book with clients, to engender a common language with which to discuss the evolving design. "That will tend to turn the client on," Alexander says, "because people recognize this stuff as relevant to their lives. You're going to make a window place so that the window is not just a hole in the wall. It's a place."</p>
                <p>The next level of involvement is to use the book's internal sequences as a guide for the entire design process. In the case of an individual home, Alexander notes, this might begin with the pattern Site Repair, which concludes, "Leave those areas that are the most precious, beautiful, comfortable, and healthy as they are, and build new structures in those parts of the site which are least pleasant now." Having sited the house accordingly, the design then proceeds through South Facing Outdoors, Positive Outdoor Space, and so on.</p>
                <p>For his own projects, Alexander gives the book even freer rein. After helping clients in siting the house, often using clay and a topographical model of the site, Alexander typically asks them to produce the initial freehand plans. A staff member then translates the sketches for design development, taking great care to preserve the spirit of the original scheme.</p>
                <p>On some projects, clients use the patterns to envision a plan and then lead Alexander on an eyes-closed tour through the imagined house. For each room, in succession, he might ask, "What do you see when you enter?" If they are unable to say, he might prompt them, "If it was the most beautiful house you can imagine, if it were everything you could want, what would we see?" Though the method is unconventional, the results have been impressive. "The incredible thing is, they will be able to answer this question," Alexander says. "It will usually be something that has some deep imagination in it."</p>
                <p>Architects and builders might blanch at such an intimate collaboration, and Alexander grants that not all clients are ready to go that far. "To some people it's to their taste, to others it's not." Still, A Pattern Language's greatest potential lies in helping clients bring their deepest feelings to the design process. When given such an opportunity, Alexander says, "They give you better work. They give you more of themselves."</p>
                <p>Designers might fear that opening the process so much will erode their control, or that working with specific patterns will limit their own creativity. Alexander insists the contrary. "It will not take away from you as an artist. It will probably let you perform as an artist at a level you were not able to attain before."</p>
                <p>The four projects on the following pages provide strong support for that assertion. Designed by Alexander and three other architects, each using A Pattern Language in his own way, these are anything but cookbook homes. But while they speak eloquently of their sites, their owners, and their architect's vision, they share a certain quality that is hard to define.</p>
                <p>Call it comfort, livability, humaneness, or what you will. You will know it when you see it.</p>
                <p>Northwest Passage Eugene, Ore., architect David Edrington's history with A Pattern Language goes back to before the book was even published. Fresh out of architecture school in the early 1970s, he and a partner met Christopher Alexander, whose earlier work the pair had encountered in their studies. "He gave us a xerox copy of the manuscript for A Pattern Language," Edrington says. "I've been using it ever since."</p>
                <p>Enchanted with the photographic examples that accompany each pattern, Edrington was even more impressed with the book's scientific rigor and ability to draw clients into the design process. "To me this was the most concrete, orderly, useful work that I had seen in generating user participation," Edrington says. And while the patterns in the book were often stunningly blunt in their recommendations, they were not prescriptive in matters of style. "Chris was always clear that it was up to a particular group of people in a particular place to interpret those patterns for themselves."</p>
                <p>That flexibility is clear in this house on the Mckenzie River outside Eugene, Ore., which employs Pattern Language principles and design sequences in a distinctly Pacific Northwest idiom. Built on the pattern Long Thin House, which maximizes exterior wall surface, the building creates a remarkable balance between a sense of shelter and openness to the outdoors.</p>
                <p>The kitchen's table alcove is a classic Pattern Language solution. Edrington calls it "a way for people to be in the kitchen, where all the activity is without being in the way." It is also the kind of place people are naturally drawn to, even if they can't say why. In Edrington's view, part of the power of A Pattern Language is its ability to explain such attractions. When clients read the book, he says, "A light bulb turns on and they start to understand why those intuitions make sense."</p>

                <p>Comforts of Home With two Pattern Language co-authors among its three principals, the Berkeley, Calif., architecture firm Jacobson Silverstein Winslow has long attracted clients who are fans of the book. Few, however, have been as familiar with the work as the owners of this Northern California country home. "They knew this book very, very well," says architect Max Jacobson. In defining their desires for their new house, he remembers, "It's like they said, 'This book is what we want.'" The couple was even more familiar with the site, which they had owned and camped on for more than a decade. The combination led to a design that is remarkably attuned to both the land and the people for whom it was built.</p>
                <p>Strung along the wooded edge of a meadow, the house spreads to take in the dramatic views and to shape livable outdoor areas. "It's very nice to be in those spaces, because you're surrounded by building," Jacobson says. "You're held in the palm of the hand of this building." The building's edges are defined by the galleries, porches, and deep, useful balconies extolled in A Pattern Language. "They are places to live outside the building," Jacobson says.</p>
                <p>And while porches offer shelter at the outside, a multitude of nooks, alcoves, and window seats serve the same function within, creating intimate spaces at the edges of larger rooms.</p>
                <p>Due to the owner's deep involvement with the project, Jacobson says, few things about the finished house took them by surprise. "They knew the building pretty well." One pleasant exception was the stair, which Jacobson calls "the heart of the house." Turning twice in its run, the stair joins with a long landing between floors. "It's just there to pause and look back down," Jacobson says. "It's not utilitarian; it's about the beauty of using a stair."</p>

                <p>Into the Woods Of the 253 patterns in A Pattern Language, a few are marked with a double asterisk after the title. "In these cases," the authors believed, "the pattern describes a deep and inescapable property of a well-formed environment." Among such essential forms are Connection to the Earth--a groundedness that makes it "impossible to say exactly where the building stops and the earth begins"--and Sheltering Roof--a low-eaved roof with that not merely covers the living space "but surrounds it." This guest house on the coast of Maine demonstrates at a glance the profound aesthetic resonance of these two patterns.</p>
                <p>"It was tailor-fitted to a little clump of woods," says architect John Silverio of the building, which bends along its spine to wrap around a grove of trees. The cedar-shingled walls flare at their base like a tree trunk, seeming to emerge directly from the soil. Trim is painted the colors of bark and evergreen.</p>
                <p>The broad-eaved roof defines much of the character of the spaces within. Low at its edges, it arches into an eyebrow at the cave-like entry and steps up a half-story over the living room. Second-floor rooms are all inside the roof, lighted with dormers. A pyramid-roofed cupola pours light down the stair near the building's center.</p>
                <p>While its references to New England Shingle style and Nordic church architecture are plain, the design traces a deeper thread, one that leads back to the archetypal woodland cottage of fairy tales. In Silverio's view, A Pattern Language supports the search for such archetypes, images of shelter and beauty that are not merely in the eye of the beholder but reside in our collective cultural memory. Knowingly or unknowingly, he says, it is a search we all engage in. "We seek these things, and they nurture us."</p>
