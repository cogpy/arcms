    <p class="MsoNormal">Dr. Quillien and I enjoyed our visit to Duncanville enormously, and appreciated the warmth and hospitality we experienced from every one of you in the city and in the workshop. We want to thank you for the dedication of your effort, for the effort of all your city staff, council, and of the business leaders we met; and especially for the warmly expressed personal enthusiasm of your personal response to what we did. I have heard of Texas hospitality, and my word, you certainly did us proud.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Thinking carefully <span style='mso-bidi-font-size:13.5pt'>during the return trip home and in the days since our visit</span>, of your special duties and responsibilities for development, and of your team’s commitment to bring major economic development to the city in the next few years, we thought it might be helpful to strongly underline an aspect of urban planning which we did not touch in the workshop due to time constraints – perhaps because we thought that all of you understood it without question. In retrospect, we both feel it is something that needs to be said, and underlined, even if all of you already know it.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The essence of economic development is the synergy of the projects: the synergy provided by customers, flow of traffic, location, and connection. Everyone knows that. It is obvious. Less obvious is the fact that this synergy can only be provided by strong pedestrian connections which bind the projects together, and provide each one with the economic support of the others as a result of interactions, flow of people, economic transactions. None of this can happen, if this space is not pedestrian, and if it is not coherent, and if it is not continuous.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">This is completely obvious to successful developers. Virtually all major economic development of the last fifty years has taken place in shopping malls and shopping plazas. Why? Because these places contain a massive pedestrian hull, and all the businesses connect to it, and therefore feed off each other. Parking is essential too, but parking is secondary to the existence of the pedestrian spine which binds a shopping mall or shopping plaza and makes it work.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">This is, of course, common wisdom among the developers who built the great shopping centers and shopping malls of the late-20<sup>th</sup> century. All of them work because they create a pedestrian precinct, and all retail, office space, and business opens off, and connects with the connective tissue of this pedestrian precinct.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">However, in the last decade, two things have begun to happen to shopping centers and malls. First, there has been growing public discontent with the stiffness and artificiality and – frankly – with the commercialism of these 20<sup>th</sup>-century plazas. Second, these plazas never found a way to integrate their success with the existing, humane nature of community in an actual town. Instead they destroyed it, by going offshore (so to speak) <u>outside</u> the naturally existing centers of a town – and this phenomenon of destroying cities to make shopping centers work is now more and more widely disparaged.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">Our effort, and your effort, to make Duncanville Main Street work, is essentially the idea of trying to make a major shopping mall or shopping plaza, IN town, instead of outside town.<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> This is certainly capable, in principle, of working. But it is far from obvious. It is new. In a few European cities which have reactivated pedestrian cities (Vienna, Copenhagen, and so on) it works. But in American cities, with a greater emphasis on cars, it is new. It still needs demonstrating. And it is innovative. And it is vitally important, because it creates the possibility that community, not only economics, can be sustained and given new life. <u>The possibility of the Main Street corridor as a real, people-based community, in which old parts of Duncanville, and old values, mingle with the new economic engine of development – that is the great innovation Duncanville has put on the table.</u></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The great and useful innovation which PatternLanguage.com has brought to this discussion, is to show how this approach to the creation of a successful economic engine, and the creation of the pedestrian hull which MUST exist to make the economic engine work, can be created not by destroying but by preserving and by taking off from what is there, not merely – as is more usual in development -- from a virgin set of plans of a shopping mall as something external, foreign and unrelated: provided this is done within a mental context that always looks towards a vision of the whole. Further, we have also begun to think out ways in which the whole two-mile long corridor can be seen as a single thing, with visionary qualities. That was not discussed at the workshop, because there simply wasn’t time for everything. This , too, is a necessary feature of the economic engine, if it is going to succeed.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The three major developers now about to break ground along Main Street -- John and Larry of the Hilton, Monte of the Main Station project, and Gary of the WindRiver project, are all fully aware of this, and in conversation with us have supported it thoroughly. Indeed, they are somewhat concerned because this glue that exists in a typical shopping plaza, is not yet there. They know, instinctively, that if the pedestrian people-connecting tissue is not provided by the city, their own projects will then fail in the long run, or at least fail to take off with spectacular economic success, and if so, the initiative of the City of Duncanville will fail economically, also.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">What is the summary of this situation. You personally -- Mayor Repp, Kent Cagle,<span style="mso-spacerun: yes"> </span> Earle Jones, and the City of Duncanville -- have very wisely initiated three major projects, chosen so as to be located at three strategic points, the Hilton at the top, the Main Station in the middle, and WindRiver at the bottom of Main Street. That is excellent thinking because the one end, the middle and the other end start to build the whole. But where is the pedestrian glue that would have made them work if these same businesses had been part of an old time shopping plaza? It isn’t there yet.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">The sad truth, therefore, and the danger to the city, is that if you leave it at that, the city, and the economic engine you hope to build, will fall flat on its face. The necessary synergy to make these projects succeed economically, will not be there, the city will be embarrassed, and even these large projects, which have consumed so much of the city’s money, will ultimately fail: at the very least they will not bring in the bonanza you hope for, and your initiative will look – from the perspective of about five years from now – sadly flawed, a magnificent experiment, but a failure.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">We urge you, therefore, to recognize the necessity of making a coherent pedestrian environment, STARTING NOW, ultimately running the length of the main street corridor, and starting now, with needed modifications (very modest ones, that can easily be inserted without slowing construction schedules ) to the three projects which are about to break ground. If you do not move very quickly, it will be too late to make these projects act as seeds for the pedestrian structure – and if these three projects do not create the needed environment for pedestrians, instead of showing the way to a truly new economic engine of the 21<sup>st</sup> century, they are more likely to represent a has-been, an effort to give Duncanville an economic facelift, but without sufficient knowledge or wisdom to actually do the trick.</p>
    <p class="MsoNormal"><![if !supportEmptyParas]>&nbsp;<![endif]></p>
    <p class="MsoNormal">For the sake of the city, of its people, and above all for the sake of its businesses, large and small, we strongly urge that you discuss among yourselves, this possible omission in your current plans for Main Street development, from the point of view expressed in this letter, and that you take this VERY seriously.</p>
