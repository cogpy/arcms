  <blockquote>
    Dear Dr. Alexander,
    <p>Thank you so much for your nice message, and for opening these opportunities for all of us. Here is an update, although not very brief, of the efforts. Some extra details are included in case they may be useful on the PL website.</p>
    <p>I have been using the principles of unfolding wholeness in a number of ways to transform our region. In regards to implementing the new planning process, our latest efforts have become quite political, to re-energize democracy in our area.</p>
    <p>We established a political action committee (PAC) called Voters to Stop Sprawl-Stafford. In our County Supervisor elections in November 2001, we had 2 of our 4 endorsed candidates elected to office, resulting in a slow-growth majority on our Board (4 out of 7). I was leading the Stafford effort, and in just six weeks of intense work and campaigning, with God’s help, we managed to alter our political infrastructure.</p>
    <p>The Voters to Stop Sprawl grassroots movement started in Loudoun County, Virginia in 1999, where they replaced 8 of their 9 county supervisors with slow-growth candidates in the November 2000 elections, having all 8 of their endorsed candidates elected to office. see website</p>
    <p>The City of Fredericksburg started a chapter in 2000 having 2 of their 3 candidates elected, including the new mayor, who was a political long shot. In the May 2002 elections, VSS Fredericksburg had 3 of their 4 city council candidates elected. The city now has a government that is pro-community, anti-special interests.</p>
    <p>And we are helping surrounding counties start VSS chapters as their local elections come up. It is becoming a regional effort.</p>
    <p>In regards to the user-initiated development legislation introduced to our Board of Supervisors in the fall of 2000, this is what has been accomplished as of last fall:</p>
    <p>1. The user-initiated zoning amendment was proposed to the County Supervisors and they unanimously voted 7-0 to proceed.</p>
    <p>2. The amendment moved to the Planning Commission for study and recommendation, where it was enthusiastically received by the planning director and staff during the working sessions. Thus the planning staff recommended it be passed by the Planning Commission.</p>
    <p>3. On the night of the vote, I spoke and made a power point presentation, using some images from your website to show the results of this method. The planning director also made a similar presentation, and was holding his copy of A Pattern Language. But something political seems to have happened behind the scenes, surprising all of us, with the Planning Commission voting 6-1 against it !</p>
    <p>4. Thus it went back to the Board of Supervisors, where it has been sitting awaiting action. As far as I know, it has not yet been voted upon.</p>
    <p>So, that is the latest from the opposite shore. I will forward any new information as it becomes available.</p>
    <p>With gratitude to you, your family, and your colleagues for giving us this great hope,</p>
    <p>Stavroula</p>
