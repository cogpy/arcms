                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hey Rob, It's the wee hours, I just got home and checked what's been happening and WOW this Buddhabrot is beautiful!!! I remember when some early pictures from the Hubble telescope showed forms that looked like columns of smokey, coral-reefy stuff, and The closest thing I had seen to them was the forms of the stone columns on the facade of Gaudi's Sagrada Familia Cathedral. I thought, "So that's what he was 'talking' about!" Will definitely have things to ask you later. Also, got by the Upham house again today and quickly snapped some pics with a funky camera that was on the dash and hopefully not too baked to work. I'll see very soon.<br>
                Dirk,<br>
                Regarding discovery/invention, I notice that the word invention seems to correspond to Latin roots for "in" and "wind" as in "ventilation." And it seems a pretty good beginning to a subjective attempt to describe the experience of participating in an "invention-event"--it just blows into your head. Often people describe being "receivers" of "creative information" in a very passive way when it actually "comes,"--dreams, trances, absorbtive reveries--even though they may have much more strenuously "set the stage" by making many kinds of preparations--consciously studying something, imitating masters, playing scales, etc. Edison comes to mind as someone who really busted ass on exploratory investigations as part of the process, whereas Edgar Cayce would just lie down and enter a sleep-like trance state. For almost thirty years now, I have been a student of Adi Da Samraj. He often will pose a question that acts as a koan (to use the Buddhist term) such as, "What do you do, exactly, when you want to have a thought?" to point out that many times we assume that we are the active agent in situations, but actually it's not really the case. We aren't the agent that is doing the breathing or the digesting, for instance, even though our language is set up in such a way that we beg the question. We say,"Oh, well that digestion is being handled by my parasympathetic nervous system--it's all kind of automatic but it's me you know--'I'm' the CEO here." When actually it is more accurate to say we are being lived. And, we don't know what a single thing is. We can collect all kinds of descriptive information ABOUT things, but we can't account at all for the Isness of anything, the Beingness. Even though Adi Da has said "All there is is is," we don't know what "is" is.</font>

Sometimes you can get lucky and program something simple that mimics complex natural phenomena, and sometimes you have to know much more about the phenomena. But exponential growth algorithms can be found in abundance.... There has been an explosion of such "experiments" in the last couple years with the release of Macromedia Flash, which is a very friendly environment for anyone to learn to program in. You can find lots of interesting approximations of natural phenomena at "flash experiment" sites like www.levitated.net, www.bit-101.com, and the sites they link to. There's a great variety to be found at these sites because Flash is so flexible, but there are some really beautiful things there. The "Buddhabrot" at levitated.net is a recent experiment that's particularly mesmerizing. If I saw some pictures of the wings, I might be able to find something specific.</font></p>

                Thanks for the link to the hutong pictures. I would like to see some courtyard garden type environments with plantlife in evidence. The old buildings are, of course, magnificent, but the grey stone/concrete all around seemed hard and stark, no doubt very comforting as a bomb shelter for the General, but not very inviting for me as a place to dwell. The Chinese are not shy about using red abundantly. Perhaps because I am a "Westerner," I don't always enjoy that much red, although I sometimes like it. I think I have experienced hutongs in Tokyo. I was impressed there by the tiny alley-streets, mostly for walkers and bicyclists, but sometimes used by very small trucks and cars. These were like capillaries that led off multi-lane highrise-lined arterial roads and within a few blocks filtered out almost all the chaos of a hundred yards away, leaving a quiet, human-scale zone where you could see a carpenter calmly ride to work with a few tools in a bag on his bicycle, pull up to a little house and disappear inside to work. It was very nice.<br></font>

                That is wonderful that you might facilitate image exchange and drawing and hyperlinking to overcome the limits of tree-type formations.<br>
                One use I am interested in finding out how to use a computer for has to do with studying/replicating patterns on moth wings. Around here we have, in particular, some "Oak Moths" who have very complex, very fine patterns on their wings that seem to help them blend in with Oak Tree bark. Some years back I was reading with a lamp in a camp during the active season of the moths ,so they kept landing on my reading materials. Now, the colors they are using are not very attention grabbing--lots of greys and browns--so I had never really apppreciated them before. HOWEVER, when I got a really intimate look at ten or twenty, I saw that each one was different, like snowflakes, and their patterns were mysteriously, utterly spectacular, even though and maybe even BECAUSE OF the fact that they were using such an apparently limited palette. To try to explain: boundaries and gradients were amazingly utilized to produce design lines that were often extremely subtle and yet extremely sharp at the same time. Let's say there were one million grey tones. Sometimes a pattern would be formed by grey #597,652 outlining a field of grey #597,653. To form such a design by human efforts would, I imagine, take years and years just to make all the marks, not to mention deciding where to put them. With computer technology I think one could get a handle on first photograghing them and then scanning them, then replicating them and studying them to understand their appeal better and then hopefully using them in skillful ways.<br>
                One of the fascinating aspects of these wings is that although the designs seem infinitely varied and "wild" they also seem completely right, calm, rested! They all seem perfectly related to the shapes of the wings, which are very elegant and poised shapes, and their (the wing shapes') bilaterally symmetrical effect acts as counterpose to the apparent chaos of the patterns inside the wing field. Chaos is not the right word, there is profound freedom and profound order evident at the same time.It's the symmetry/asymmetry riddle of the Japanese kimono again. That is something I would really like to get a better understanding of. If you can point me to presently available computer tools to bring to bear, I would love it.<br>
                The next thing about moth/butterfly wings is the color lesson. I love looking at the things that they pull off, totally wild and yet with perfect poise. CA worried about his color choices on the Upham House turning out to be "silly." However, interesting color was necessary to enliven the grey mass, and the amount of color was so small that any vividness was not in danger of being too much, imo. I would have gone for color delineating the boundary of the edge of the roof as well, but under-coloring is one of my compaints about houses generally in this neck of the woods.</font>

I imagine you'll be back, everyone seems to return to Bellingham after a while! I'll look up your friend when I get a chance... It's funny, Whatcom County has ~150,000 people, and our library system has The Timeless Way, APL, Production of Houses, AND NOO 1 & 2... I had to wait 3 months for my turn, they're in such hot demand. (Compare to Chicago Public Library - 0 copies in 90,000,000 libraries....) I love this town. It's frustrating though, to see subdivision development coming in, where so many of the houses here have their individual flair.</font></p>

It also contains an online sketching tool, and allows you to link photos and Web pages to the verbal description. It will also have forum capabilities similar to photo.net. It's a good idea to link the sketch tool to the forums, I hadn't thought of that.

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">here's somebody interesting--Carlos Scarpa. From: Carlos Scarpa Architect, Intervening with History. Remodeling by a master artist/architect of classical old Italian buildings at a very high level of sensitivity.<br>
                "I think that Venice, more than any other Italian city, could accomodate the modern expression of architecture. Because of certain of it's asymmetries--its very varied skyline, with high and low buildings, its streets broad and narrow. And it has very beautiful interior spaces, so if it wold be possible to preserve things of this type in the historic fabric, there would be no fear of spoiling the city, so long as designs were carried out in a manner...worthy of it." Carlos Scarpa 1978</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Museo di Castelvecchio<br>
                " At Castelvecchio the builders of olden times had tackled the problem of the formal identity of a series of dwellings and their connection. The rooms were laid out in rows, beween two walls distant and distinct from each other. They were the two facades of the castle. The more ancient of the two walls is solid, almost without apertures. It opened towards the river, on the outside. The other,more recent one was less massive and opened out onto the garden. You see how the building retains its identity in time: it's a basic principle....I wanted to preserve the originality, the character of every room, but I didn't want to use the wooden beams of the earlier restoration. Since the rooms were square, I set a paired steel beam to support the point where the two reinforced concrete beams crossed, so indicating the main lines of the building's formal structure. Where they crossed the importance of that square was emphasized because the crossing of the two beams in the center implies the pillar which helps define the square.<br>
                This is the visual logic I wanted to use as a frame of reference. The way the beams were made also brings out the visual logic, but only in the details. I could have used the steel profiles already on the market, but it would have been an engineering solution without any visual emphasis. I thought it would be more interesting to take the profiles and make a composition out of them. The new joints reveal the structure of the element and the new functions." p67</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">"Scarpa called for a return to the "ancient " discipline of drawing as the generative force of invention, and with it the recovery of the poetic independence of design, with a "distictive personal character that would lend each work the moral authority that everyone in the world of art must strive for." Beginning with a famous lecture in 1963, he strenuously defended decoration, arguing--with the example of the microphone stem's tubular column before him--that forms remain 'un-finite,' and thus inexpresssive, without it. He believed that a syntax of color and ornament becomes inevitable in an architectural project from the moment the designer makes the first choice of a material, resist as one might.<br>
                Scarpa also advocated a return to the sensory delight that comes from what can be touched and felt in each material, to the intellectual excitment that derives from exploring and unveiling its structural characteristics,and to the logical pleasures of seeing how distinctive materials with different properties can be wed. He asked us to re-acknowledge the potential of materials to drive the generative process and produce a ruling idea for the larger work:"It is a curious facultythis, which enables us to sense that a certain dimensional factor, a thickness for instance, can become the determining characteristic of the physical value of things." Above all, he insisted that the building of a vocabulary of material and ornament was a critical step in capturing those senses---tactile, psychological, and mnemonic, that open a work of architecture to "maximum expression and meaning." p13</font></p>

                A few quotes from Rex Roberts, Your Engineered Home published 1964.<br>
                "Some years ago in West Groton, Dick Bissel was putting up a house. I stopped to look the place over. Dick, a friend and fellow carpenter, rested while I looked.<br>
                After a while, when I hadn't managed to find anything very flattering to say, Dick remarked, "You have to admit it's too good for chickens." I admitted it. He frowned. "But it's not quite big enough for cows."<br>
                In criticising his own handiwork, Dick expressed his sorrow that most human houses are less satisfactory than they might have been. Somehow, in this largest of human expenditures, we are not getting our money's worth." p. 10</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">"Discussion of remodeling must run either to a few hundred words and stop there, or go on to several million. There is no sensible place to stop in between.<br>
                Our few hundred words here will be devoted to stating the general case against remodeling. If you, for excellent reasons of your own, decide to ignore this generalization and plunge ahead with a remodeling job, the number of problem variations multiplied by the number of possible solutions becomes astronomical. In remodeling, sight-unseen advice is worthless. A million words wouldn't even get us started.<br>
                By remodeling I do not mean normal maintainance or even normal updating to keep a house from becoming obsolete. I refer to major structural changes and major technical additions which are neede to make a building too good for chickens." p168<br>
                "I grant you that the very difficulties of remodeling can stimulate the imagination, sometimes producing an end result of great charm. If your imagination is like that, remaining silent in the empty outdoors but triggered by an assembly of roughly rectangular walls and rooofs, a tumble-down barn is what you need, cheap. If these are your symptoms, my suggestion is that you buy the barn, stare at it for a while,draw your plans, then tear down the barn and start fresh somewhere else. I have already admitted that great charm can result from a major remodeling. Unfortunately, charm created in this manner is in most cases an expensive luxury." "We all know, however, that all generalizations are false, including this one. Under what circumstances might it me emotionally if not financially sound to undertake a remodeling?<br>
                "In the preservation, of course, of a minor historical monument. The house becomes adinnertable conversation piece which can repay all the effort you put into it....In the use of enclosed space, the shell of which is in good repair. I'm a sucker for this one myself, because it keeps the carpenters in out of the rain..." p. 168</font></p>

                Mulling over your foray into repair- renovate-remodel, I was making a tricky cut for some lintel trim clearance, getting some old siding out of the way, when something possibly helpful occured to me.<br>
                First, there is the almost medical, surgical aspect.(Don't cut too deep or far.)<br>
                Second encompasses the "can of worms syndrome" of finding soft wood, outdated utility infrastructure, minimal insulation, foundation issues, etc.<br>
                Third, How does this change Tie In structurally?, esthetically?, investmentwise?<br>
                Fourth, how are human activities and uses, privacy, views etc. affected in the old and new sections of the work?</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">How many times have you heard people say "It's way easier to build new.", or " In hindsight we should have started over from scratch."?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Successfully done, there's few things more satisfying than a complementary addition or renovation, but the above oft-heard phrases are a testimony to the difficulty of pulling it off easily in the modern scenario.<br>
                <br>
                I think the primary reason it is harder to renovate or remodel is that the old work must be constantly read for "centers" and "wholeness". And, the old work, or it's outlying border elements, are often in your way. Even out at the edge of a new addition there are visual, auditory, and other physical and psychic connections to the antecedent structure that will be made, harmoniously or not.<br>
                New centers must be established, old centers must be preserved, supported, re-interpreted. It gets to be a bit of a puzzle compared to making the thing up out of whole cloth....</font></p>

                About free will, yes we do have free will, but "not in circumstances of our own making"... this makes a difference.<br>
                About structure (and culture) preserving transformations, again, I'm not sure how we can apply them to social situations exactly.<br>

                Maybe so, but its a bit like an evil indulgence, better to be close and visible rather than distant and unseen. I can't see how Alexander can control discussions about his ideas, particularly around the world, whether he wants to be associated with many of the particular views is another thing. I would think it would be an advantage though to be discussing close by and preferably in the open...</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Nature of Order vol. 2 chapter 1, "The Principle of Least Action" explains river behavior which creates the marshes. A dike breaks across all this balanced structure, symmetry, and "laziness". It is a catastrophic change.<br>
                How far do we want to go back in our "constructive demolition"? what was the pre-Saddam hydrology? When did the desire for fans and freezers start? It's hard to keep 'em down on the farm after they've seen Gay Paree!<br>
                On the other hand, you don't know what you got till it's gone and there may be many who are willing to devote there lives to getting it back, if given the chance.<br>
                Reading further in chapter 2 we come across another related universal with great explanatory power called "minimum symmetry breaking".<br>
                "The system acts to preserve as much of it's structure as possible" is the root quote.<br>
                It should be recognized that our human motivations are also gathered into the fold here. We are acting as a part of nature, trying to preserve our essential physical and cultural structures whether they be human bodies, families, governments, religions, neighborhoods, etc. Sadamm saw the area as out of his reach and threatening so he dried it up to protect his "structure".<br>
                When you have creative power and free will, you get this kind of collision of worlds. One system imposes on another, often needlessly, due to fear and insecurity.<br>
                These debilitating emotions are ultimately sourced in the irony of the genetic survival game which built us, but which our creative and destructive powers have now outstripped. Another case of a phase shift struggling to transform, while preserving as much of it's structure as possible.<br>
                I actually think Alexander is onto something with huge expanatory and unifying power, and hope, for a species which can think.<br>

                Last July, when I looked in here, this chat was the only one actually happening out of the four listed, and that is still the case. I guess the people behind this site are too busy/underfunded to add to it yet. I'm sure that CA wants to be very careful with trying to control the integrity of his communications out here as people start talking about his ideas. I also would guess that a lot of their resources are tied up getting vol 3 and 4 out the door to the world. But it seems to me that CES could have one hell of an interesting magazine. I'm sure that is in the plan. Next week when I am in the SF Bay Area again I will take a camera by the Upham House and get some pics and put them on a CD. Maybe Rob can post them on his site, or someone else that is able to do that can chime in here and let me know they are interested in posting it. Then we can all go from here to there, take a look, come back here and discuss. I would be interested to hear about your projects, and other people's also. Failing that, I will send you a copy of the CD in the mail or via computer if I can manage--I'm not very computer savvy myself.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">William Buckley's story sounds interesting and tragic. The Aborigine culture, what I heard of it, is remarkable. They are the only known group that relinquished agriculture after observing that it was not sustainable, I heard. There is someone who lives in Tasmania, I think in a very simple, close to the earth mode, who wrote a book on Sacred Geometry who also did one on the Aborigines from a point of view of profound respect for some of the spiritual dimensions of their culture--at least what he was permitted to see of them. Amazing.</font></p>

                With six billion people, I'm not convinced about how much new building births are actually necessary... I would have thought there is enough built space in the world to accommodate shelter needs for many if not most people in the world already... the only imperative now being to repair, make functional, beatify and above all make accessible to everbody.<br>

                If only it had a sketch pad or something similar, doesn't even need to be very sophisticated... it would greatly aid in allowing discussion of actual and concrete examples.

Anyway, he escaped from prison and lived with the local aboriginal people for 32 years, and the story goes, actually 'lived' very much with them, became them, had forgotten the English language, absorbed their deep spiritual way of seeing and connecting with the land and people, so much so that when he was later found he essentially did not remember or comprehend his own 'white' past. He was taken back into white society, and later, although he remained friends with his aboriginal friends, not through lack of spiritual integrity, but through naivety betrayed them.</font></p>

                Just to clarify a side issue, but nonetheless an important one, it is aknowledged by many in Victoria that David Holmegren, the co-founder of PC was equally instrumental in the emergence of the PC movement- and many say that it was actually he who had the ecological backround...

                I was looking through a paperback full of quotes by Picasso about art to various people over many years. It was obvious that he didn't care about contradicting himself at all, that he enjoyed being a trickster with his verbal communications. One thing he said that particularly struck me was a pronouncement that "painting is destruction." I thought he must be pulling the leg of whoever he was talking to. About a year later I happened to see a film that was made showing Picasso painting. He painted on plexiglass for the process. It was very interesting because a very rapid recording of sequences of a master. He finished "a painting," and then rubbed out about 90% of it and generated another painting off of the fragment. Then he did it again and again about 15 times. At a certain point, the filmmaker said, I only have 2 minutes of film left, is that OK? (Picasso had just wiped out almost everything again) Picasso is completely at ease, says "sure" takes a drag on his cigarette, and finishes another really outrageous composition within the remaining time without any apparent effort. I plan to re-watch that one to study it in the light of CA's 15 transformations/sequences. But it was interesting what he demonstrated about "destruction" too. Turned out he was not just playing with the interviewer when he said it. You get to see him make and wipe out 10 or 20 million bucks worth of art in about a half hour.<br>
                Jujol also was known for ordering an iron railing, then, when it was delivered, deliberatly having it bent and broken and deformed before installing it, and his work is perhaps the most alive I have seen. "Punctuated equilibrium" applied, perhaps. Another story was that while he was instructing the smith to twist and deform the iron, sometimes it would break, and Jujol would scold the iron. For him, building materials were alive.<br>
                I knew a guy from Nigeria who had been raised in an African magical context as a child but had come to the US for a degree in engineering. One day he was telling me about a rock masonry project he was doing a beautiful job on, and he mentioned that the rocks were very angry about being moved from their resting places and put into the wall, and that if you were not careful while working with them, they would look for a chance to drop on your foot and nail you if they had a chance.</font></p>

                I like the implications a question like this brings up for Alexander's work on Order.<br>
                I think his discoveries about the essential unities in any creative or restorative enterprise will eventually be a big help in solving this kind of complex and difficult problem.<br>
                You are probably the first and slightly ahead of you time in making the connection, but I believe there is great relavance and utility in the application with much more to follow in time.<br>
                Alexander may have begun with architecture, but the implications of his present work are certainly powerful enough to lend some clarity to your question of a nature, culture, political, intersection in the former marshlands of the Tigris-Euphraties delta.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I'll give it a very quick stab and revisit later after a hoped-for post by Brian.<br>
                I think one important feature is critical mass. Whatever re-settlement is initiated should be large enough in natural and social size to endure as a sustasinable "strong center". Yet it should have area to grow into, which it can prepare as "future latent centers", with solutions the community discovers.<br>
                Chances are there will be fans and freezers, if people want them now.<br>
                It's likely the "Old Ways" will only be partially reclaimed after this catastrophic episode.<br>
                The seedbed for new ideas should include restoring and maintaining the character of the marshes, as much as possible so that non-generic lives for the settlers are at least a portion of the scene, otherwise what's the point? Might as well dike and pave it.<br>
                Also the people, their motivational, intellectual, and physical resources, are crucial. This is probably the answer to your "what would you do first?" query. Find a few core groups who have had the marsh experience and have the drive to make it a life's work again, then empower them to make truly important decisions about what happens next. Mistakes will be made, sometimes expensive, That's part of it. This is the cost. As long as things move forward and the whole continues to transform and move outward, keeping the essence of the "marsh pattern", you will have life generating sequences operating.<br>
                If down the road, education and tourism become factors, it will be an affirmation of success, along with whatever alarms are raised.</font></p>

But when he and his crew hit the beach it was reverse D-Day and the Indians wiped nearly all of them out. Cabeza did some great nude getaway running and avoided getting killed, but found himself walking friendless and alone out in the boonies with nothing to eat, wear, or defend himself with. He ended up getting very skinny out there, and then he was captured by some other Indians, who could not decide if he was a human being or a devil or a god. So, the chief, who happened to have a sick daughter at the time, decided that if Cabeza De Vaca could heal his daughter overnight, then he must be some kind of good spirit, and if not, they would kill him in the morning. They communicated this somehow to Cabeza and put him in the tent with her. He proceeded to pray his ass off, and during the night sometime, he basically had a catastrophic phase shift (very burnt-up ex-conquistador+purificatory ordeal of fasting and wandering+extreme life-or-death pressure=sho'nuff, real-deal healing shaman) and awakened into a capacity to feel and channel a healing Force. In the morning, everybody was all smiles! The Indians passed him on to the next tribe and over the next few years he walked across the continent, healing the sick. When he got over to California, which was Spanish Territory at the time, he got on a boat for Spain and wrote a report to the King/Queen detailing his experiences. He also discovered that after he got back to "civilization" and got comfortable again, his powers faded away. I mention this because my feeling is that human beings have spiritual possibilities under duress that they usually can't engage because they prefer to be comfortable, and comfort seems to make these abilities recede. There is a connection between "tapas" (no, not Spanish snacks--I mean it in the yogic sense of the word for austerities!)and "siddhis" (abilities) that has been exploited since ancient time by seekers who wanted to move beyond the limits of the "normal." So, my feeling is that when situations arise such as in Iraq, where there are double-binds to the Catch-22nd power everywhere you look, you got a problem that you need a heavy-duty Spiritual Realizer to intervene in.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">As far as more ordinary people who have a history of effective discoveries that could relate to a situation like Iraq, I would suggest consulting Masanobu Fukuoka, if he is still alive. He is/was a remarkable man who wrote One Straw Revolution, The Natural Way to Farm and a third book which I forget. He was the inspiration behind Bill Mollison's work, The Permaculture guy. Fukuoka was a scientist who had a catastrophic phase shift incident as a post doctoral researcher in Japan in the twenties. One day he went into a feverish delirium in which he had two realizations which he expressed as "Human Knowledge amounts to nothing" and "plants will grow by themselves."<br>
                On the basis of this insight he quit his job cold ( the conservative Japanese colloqial expression for this<br>
                act at the time was "cutting your own throat" and returned to his father's Mandarin Orange orchard, built a hut, and started to take care of trees. The first thing that happened was, he refused to prune ("Plants will grow by themselves") and lost 400 trees. He later found that pruning threw off the natural sequence of branching and once you started, you had to continue. So trees he grew from scratch he never pruned. He went on to develop what he called "Do Nothing Farming" and performed feats like dry farming rice, no rice paddy, no weeding, no insecticides, no fertilizer, but yields higher than conventional yields in standard agriculture. In his later years he was interested in working on how to reverse the process of desertification. He advocated asking the Earth itself how to stop it. He proposed initiating a dialog with the Earth by taking all our ICBMs, packing the warheads full of every kind of seed, and shooting them out into the Sahara to see what would grow. He was a very radical, outspoken critic of the same kind of world view that CA is pointing to the limits of, and he had several great discoveries to show for his methods. Genius of his caliber I think is probably available in our population to help with messes on that kind of scale, if they can have a chance to be heard and co-operated with.<br>
                Fukuoka was shut down by the Japanese government after he refused to let them control a superior strain of rice he developed to ameliorate third world hunger. Par for the course in the Kali Yuga.<br></font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I bring a connundrum and point in case, a concrete example, one which epitomises and exemplifies and may be a microcosm of one of many possible worlds to which NOO is I believe responding to.<br>
                Curiously enough, the example just popped up on one of those news analysis programs this evening on television.<br>
                The place is the Arab marsh lands in Iraq which as you both may be aware were drained by Hussein some time ago in attempt to destroy dissident comunities, rebels, bandits, draft dodgers et...<br>
                It is described to be amongst the greatest environmental crimes and disasters of our time, not to mention the humanitarian disaster it is.<br>
                It is a world decimated of life and beauty.<br>
                A son of a former engineer (now an emigre engineer living in the US I think) and native of the land, now working with the international community to restore the marsh's through a number of projects (called Eden Again)describes the complexities, which are also testified to by the locals still living there.<br>
                'It in a way is not difficult, quite as simple as destroying some embankments and levies and letting the water just flow back into the marshes... in actual reality there are difficulties however... like, will there be enough water to cover the marshes, how will nature be able to regenerate etc...<br>
                and from the locals who are not so concerned about the scientific and ecological facts, who now instead want a "fan, a freezer and food"... and can not see what advantages the water will bring to them.<br>
                In this example we have everything, re-building, building, regeneration, sequence of necessary and relevant events and actions ie: regeneration, flooding, demolition, relocating people, locating them back etc...(and not necessarily in that order), rediscovering of the pattern languages of the place, environmental catastrophe, human catastrophe, loss of much of the beauty as well as the latent, actual and living centers etc. etc. etc.<br>
                So, my question is, how in your opinions would you go about starting even to address this type of problem?<br>
                Is the solution political, economic, cultural, architectural, ecological, military ?<br>
                Obviously its a combination of all, and appart from not really seriously expecting a broad based solution here, what can we say at least for the relevance of the ideas of NOO in this example?<br>
                What would be the first thing you would do?</font></p>

                I was highgrading a unit of 1x8 redwood this afternoon for the 40 pieces of clear stock out of 1000, and my thoughts kept returning to the interesting perspectives which have been on the site here lately.<br>
                Checking back now I realize how stochastic(shotgun-pattern-gestalt) sharing ideas of this kind is. Gregory Bateson's term, a big mentor of Stewart Brand's. G.B. is way harder to read than me, but thanks for the kind word, and don't worry I'll keep trying.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I leafed through the "How Buildings Learn", once, and remember thinking it was a worthwhile point of view. Maybe if we thought of our art and artifacts enough as organic beings with lives of their own we would encourage them the freedom to morph and grow instead of holding them close and pure like we sometimes do, as extentions of our own inviolate egos.<br>
                'Course I have watched people butcher my stuff a few times, I admit, it ain't pretty, specially at first, or when you're young.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Meeting you would be a pleasure, I'm not sure I could hold my own with your witty spins though, that last one about the rise and fall of the House of Upham is sure to be treasured as a classic.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The thing is Order itself evolves and innovation in the quality of beauty is tied to this rise of complexity and power. The Leanardo, Michealangelo level was not accessible to the cave painter.<br>
                <br>
                At points along the way Order must jump into new phase states, water, ice, cloud is a nice metaphor. Catastrophe is a way of saying one set of rules was strained beyond their limits and a new set took over. House + wind = toothpicks.<br>
                Punctuated equilibrium asserts that such things happen periodically, over and over, mainly in the context of wiping the slate almost clean for new starts. Cascade effect: it's dominos and water rushing, tributaries combining, additive stuff reaching critical trigger levels, then the whole thing finally coming to flower, or falling down. Like storm systems, .com bubbles, lemming populations, or political empires.<br>

                Reading NOO book 2 page 64 about structure-preserving transformations I see the discussion about the crumpling can and the claim that "the system acts to preserve as much of its structure as possible."<br>
                pg. 65 "What happens when the unfolding is SMOOTH? The transformation is structure preserving."<br>
                CA goes on to speak of "consistancy," "centers not being violated, but rather preserved," and "In all cases where centers are taken out, (death, pruning, simplification), they are removed, still, in such a way as to leave as many as possible of the larger centers intact."<br>

                My comment about Nature replacing rather than repairing just refers to how Nature seems to be set up around a lot of birthing. I just mean that in the wild, the sick and injured tend to become dinner for the more vigorous ones that don't have a handicap, before they can heal. So in that sense, birthing replacement is more the response to damage than fixing. But that is not to say that when it comes to "human" activities I feel we are necessarily bound to duplicate "Nature". Far from it. It seems to me that CA's focus is just on influencing the future births in new architecture in the directions he feels to "have life." Apparently, he feels enough of the world still needs to be built that it is a good line of attack.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My comments about the Upham house were just speculations/impressions from the street looking. I have no idea if the Uphams even live there anymore. Anything is possible. My impression from reading the book was that they spent extra on the foundation, and needed to take from another part of the budget even to pull that off. If they had had the money, I am sure that they woulda done concrete retaining walls in the landscape to make it all of a piece, because the wood work, as I mentioned, looks pretty tacky. But, again, I don't know why all the plants were out--- which, it seems, in ordinary conditions, should be hiding a lot of that. Maybe they just redid the wood and the plants have not had a chance to grow back yet. Or maybe the clothes from their factory,<br>
                fell out of fashion and they are going broke because their sales are down, and can't keep their yard up anymore. It is very possible, even in the USA where there is a lot of money, that you can go broke. Especially in the clothing biz, where competition is particularly ruthless. Worst case scenario, they are broke, their neighbors go broke, the area becomes...a slum! More life! CA wins again!</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I agree with you that sometimes some of CA's design choices seem arbitrary--I have had the sense that there are some things "patterns" he feels are good that he likes to "plug in," like the terrazo floors made of squares and triangles, for instance. Or the decision to use a particular material for the Upham house based on his subjective sense of what the house in his mind's eye feels like it needs to be made of. I suspect he has his favorite tricks that he likes to use, as I do mine, and it's hard to tell how objectively he proceeds as he tries to feel what the house is asking for next.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I'm glad you generate a lot of points for discussion, the first time I came to this forum, I couldn't find an echo for so long that I just forgot about it.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Nature of Order#1&2 is laying out universals, formative abstracts, going way beyond mere architecture, it is an attempt to inform our reductionist mechanistic thought with unifying themes, which to Alexander's credit include Beauty.<br>
                This is the context and perspective Alexander has chosen to work through, in my view, using architecture as his wedge tip to access and enrich our larger knowledge of the world.<br>
                And this is my reasoning for the discussion always returning here. Because Beauty, and the emotions it is tagged to, is one of only a precious few major languages of nature the cerebral cortex is fluent in.<br>
                This "Esthetic Bridge" accesses other truths about the rightness or aliveness of shapes, forms and constructions . Up until now the scientist will only admit elegance, Alexander's work is rare in that he is pushing to develop awareness and acknowledgement of the deeper underlying existence of beauty and ethical content in everything we percieve and create.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Just grazing one of the others:<br>
                So right about demolition being "constructive", and the immune system analogy to repair , and evolution akin to remodel. The thought occurs that incompleteness and mistakes should not be deplored, but celebrated as opportunity for furthur evolution in really alive buildings, of course you want value and servicability, but why not welcome eventual changes as inevitable improvement, not original failure.<br>
                Maybe it would be good to acknowledge the "temporary" nature of life and buildings and make them easier to change in the first place.<br>
                Nature repairing and/or replacing strikes me as a slippery slope, a gradient for sure, ha ,ha, while agreeing with catastrophe theory, cascade effects, punctuated equilibrium etc.<br>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I agree that CA has put forth a brilliant argument for the 'primacy of feeling', this is what I find extremely interesting and valuable. About your other points,<br>
                When does nature replace before repair? What are 'structure preserving transformations'?<br>
                My point about demolition is really a curiousity about how can it be discussed or described in relation to sequences, and patterns specifically and to the broader question of re-building the world?<br>
                It is a pity to build incorrectly in the first place, but most of the world is already built and in that state.<br>
                How is it possible to run out of money in a country as rich as the USA? I can't see how running out of money is related exactly to the type of problems about the Upham house that you described.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Dirk,</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Why do you think that discussion in this venue will always eventually return to the meaning and character of beauty and aesthetics in general?<br>
                Where is functionality and security satisfied? In how much of the world?<br>
                About "fashion and style being great drivers of markets", I would have thought that right now, as we speak literally, wouldn't it be more like oil, and large capital, at least on a broader world scale. I know that in places like Santa Monica, Rodeo drive, the largest cosmopolitan cities in Europe and the US for that matter, it might well be fashion and style.<br>
                I agree, architecture is a victim to fashion and style, at least in good parts of the western world that we're familiar with, but to say that these drive markets is another thing.<br>
                I agree, architecture may be one of the things that shape our world view, but its equally true that architecture is also a product of our particular world view... that of the reductionist, mechanical and cartesian world view that CA talks about.<br>
                And we have constructed other things also, and we did for the first time get pictures of the planet from outer space last century... this had its own radical and profound contribution maybe to how we see the world. I guess, what I am trying to say, is that often there can be a tendency to view, analyse and judge the world through the glasses of our own 'professions'. So how do we get PL and the NOO theories and ideas in perspective and context of other knowlege of the world?<br>

                You also talked about the Upham House comments I made and mentioned the Chinese courtyard house in contrast. I don't know what happened up there on Poppy Lane, I think maybe it is easier to run out of time and money in the USA. In China you can hire a gardener for $2 a month I'd guess. In the USA I think CA is doing heroic work against great odds and so far pulling off fantastic victories with a skeleton crew--a great general. I am pretty sure I would far prefer the courtyard house to the Upham house, but I wonder what it would cost to build if they were paid at American scale? I hope Ih Tiao Chang is working on a book over there, or at least a magazine article for the CES magazine, with plenty of photos and plenty of interviews with hard-working Confusians, retiring Taoists, and dead Buddhists.By the way, where is this Magazine and how do I subscribe?<br></font>

                You posed some questions and made some comments, quite a few, that nobody has responded to, so I would like to. You talked about demolition, and how that might be regarded in the creative sense. I feel that you are of course right that demolition/remodeling might be compared to a kind of healing process in a living organism. Everyone will agree that healing is positive, on the other hand, scar tissue is usually considered unattractive. But then again, those Africans turn it into a positive by rubbing ash in the cuts to make nice raised bumps (Now that's what I call DEEP INTERLOCK) to make centers out of the scars.<br>
                I guess one of CA's points is how much energy is wasted by avoidable mistakes. What a pity to build it badly in the first place. Nature is maybe more inclined to replace rather than to repair.<br>
                I thought your suggestion about squinting was very good. It relates to something recommended by Henry Schaeffer-Simmern for moving forward in a 2D design impasse--color the figure black against the ground. This helps one to improve things like positive shape recognition.<br></font>

                I think Brian's interest in the meaning and character of beauty, and esthetics in general, is at the core of what any discussion in this venue will always return to eventually. The style merchants reference is a great one; let's admit that once functionality and security is satisfied, fashion and style are the great drivers of markets, which in turn direct human endeavor. Architecture is no exception, and the results surround us for better or worse.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The recognition of the profound power of architecture to shape world-view and feeling more than any other human construction is, I think, why Alexander and the rest of us are so interested in it; what it actually is, what it really means, and what makes it good or bad, alive or dead. And of course, the doing of it, as well as we can.</font></p>

                Maybe if a virtual reality application could somehow mock up something that FELT "lifesize real" it could be of some use in this process. Maybe it could eventually be done, I imagine that it would take many billions of dollars and many more years before, say, Pixar could develop the necessary details in rendering.<br>
                I think that beauty eludes people to the extent that they are averse to the necessary labor involved in bringing it about. Because I believe that is what it takes, simply...first the disciplined labor of learning your chops in the art you devote yourself to, and second the labor of exercising those hard-won chops in the process of co-creation in Reality in the present moment. The creative labor is "painstaking," a sacrifice of time and energy, and also delightful and ecstatic.<br>
                What fuels one in such an undertaking is a kind of devotion. What does it take for CA twenty years looking at pairs of pictures 2-3 hours a day? By his confession, he was motivated to perform this sacrifice in order to try to understand how to make something beautiful. And we see his great results so far.<br>
                But I think the resort to computers in design to somehow "save time" and "get more done" is a lot of the problem because it breeds superficiality and "rubber-stamping." The disposition that produces rubber-stamping is the antithesis of the one that produces beauty. It's to lazy to do it. It says, "OK, that is good enough, now repeat the module." Whereas, the disposition that produces beauty says, "That is a beautiful center. How can I make a center near it that plays with and off it in such a way that energy is conducted between them synergetically so that they are both enhanced, more alive, more full, more delightful to experience, and they show ther relationship to the whole? That calls for a fresh invention at every stage. More work! But some of us think it is worth it.</font>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I think the most difficult aspect of these ideas is that everyone has a part to play in the process, but even those lucky few who get to custom build a home really only get to do it once in their lives, without any way to "practice" first. I wonder if an immersive online CAD application would help people get more of a feel for the process or at least the ideas, something three dimensional. On the other end of the spectrum, Mr. Alexander says the most important thing to develop first is the mental word-picture. I'm currently working on a Web site to that end.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have started applying the 15 qualities to 2D designs I create, which has been an interesting experience. Right now, it's 50/50, consciously applying a transformation leads to a better design, vs. just making a better design results in me realizing that I've successfully utilized one of the transformations. I made a tile pattern @ http://www.asumendi.com/webDesign/tilingPattern.gif and like the idea of a shower head coming from the multi-colored flower below the sun. Anyhow, it was interesting to work on bit-by-bit, strengthening various centers until I thought it was coming together. Subtle changes made a big difference in the overall feel of the thing. I certainly feel that NOO 1 has added to my set of design tools.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">An interesting experience I had the other day, I doodled a couple tile patterns on a sheet of paper. One was the beautiful Greek cross tulip pattern from the Turkish rug in NOO 2 and the other was one I developed to complement it. I left the sheet of paper on the bedstand, and the following day, absent mindedly walked into the bedroom to grab something. Without looking at it, or consciously realizing it was there, the pair of designs jumped across the room at me, they looked like a pair of eyes! Standing there, I couldn't even make out the details at all; they were too far away, yet my brain seemed to recognize the dense clusters of centers. A bit like the carpet experiences mentioned in that section of pl.com</font></p>

                Sorry I don't have a digital yet or I would email you the Upham pics. That would actually be a fun thing to do here, play "what has more life" with sets of pictures that people could comment on. Because you are right about needing something to help bring the consideration out of abstaction, as CA does so wonderfully with his illustrations and reports of his personal feelings.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">About "style merchants" I guess "they are always with us"...at least in good old capitalist totalitarian society. (If anyone among you has not tried to sell anything based on style in the last thirty days you may cast the first stone!) I read an interesting report in Metropolis about graphic design in East Germany after the Wall came down. The biz just exploded because the packaging was all generic under communism and when they started competing they needed new packaging! So, I'm not worried if people want to bring APL to bear in spec housing development. Jeez, have at it! How could we do any worse? I once lived in an Eichler house, which had, as I think most if not all of them did, an enclosed courtyard!! (Eichler was a creative spec builder in the SF Bay Area in the Fifties. I just saw a book about Eichler so I guess he is getting known.)<br>
                As for folks using sequences, when CA and Co have some to sell...I'm thinking of buying one for my house project. Right now they say they are only 10% finished with the house sequence, which they will sell for $50, and for $2000 when it is complete in about a year they say. So I just finished reading the description of the Upham House, trying to glean some rough insight from that, which reflects 12 years ago's thinking, and I did get a rough idea...also, from his description of helping his student learn how to design by feeling-figuring out the most important thing, drawing it, the next most important thing, draw it...etc. I assume that is the simple essence of it. The simple essence is mock it up as big as you can, feel it, shift it around in relationship to other parts until the whole assembly lives and doesn't trip on itself and irritate you, and build it.<br>
                CA says people didn't seem to be able to use APL successfully on their own, and he's on sequences as the solution to that. His arguments about the number of errors in the average house and what they actually cost are really interesting, and explains to me why my intuition regarded so many houses as actually being worth negative! (OK... I'll take that quitclaim deed, if you insist!)Hence the value of his sequences approach, which is supposed to allow one to walk along "Alexander's Razor" and miss all the gazillions of potential wrong turns on your way "home." I'll buy that, in theory.<br>
                But basically I think CA is just presenting a brilliant comprehensive argument for the primacy of feeling as the ultimate arbiter in building decisions. That feeling has a universal, "populist dimension" in that anyone can "feel it" for themselves, and it also has an elitist, esoteric dimension--not everyone can pull "Rhapsody In Blue" out of the ether, but when someone does, we can mostly all recognize it and value it as special. CA SORT OF says, follow the sequences I'm going to show you, and you'll get "Rhapsody In Blue"--you can reason out a method to get to inspiration. He also realizes that feeling sensitivity develops with practice, AND that something was going on in that old temple site in Japan where he had that "staged-pre-designed" meeting with the dragonfly that is beyond his present understanding and that is NOT available to be inspected with his thinking mind. Nor can he package and sell that capacity. The most he could do is find out what the practice there was and IF there is a Master available who can transmit it to him If he is willing to meet the requirements of that practice. It is a conceit of the Westerm DIY mentality that Inspiration is reducible to a recipe that the ego can simply grab and appropriate.<br>
                Creativity, Originality, Inspiration... these matters are profoundly esoteric.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">As for the art vs. eggs and steak, it's always interesting, isn't it? As for me, my tastes are simple, I only want the best. (quote Mae West I think) I'm only interested in doing unique, very high-end work for clients who also only want and can afford the best, so that is what I do. Yes, every tile is a plate of steak and eggs, and from a very expensive restaurant, to boot. That's good. If you make them pay more, they appreciate it more!<br></font></p>

                I have a number of concerns about applying the 15 principles:<br>
                1. The emergence of 'style' merchants<br>
                2. It becoming a cosmetic treatment<br>
                3. That ordinary people will never make meaningful application of them, for various reasons (ie: budget being one amongst many others).<br>
                4. As they are abstract, it becomes incredibly difficult to apply them and to discuss them... particularly as they become detached from real experience the discussion invariably can entail an endless scenario of 'what if' possibilities, all quite arbitrary from the actual life generating circumstances.<br>
                5. Because of their abstract nature, their ability to stand alone as principles'they will lend themselves to being seperated from patterns theory and in this sense can be as potentially damaging as many other 20th C ideas. (I'm probably totally wrong, but I'll keep playing the devils advocate here).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My criticism is this, that each one of those tiles would roughly be equivelant to a plate full of steak and eggs. But I'm not necessarily saying that we don't need art and we only live on bread alone.<br>
                In the Julian Sreet Inn I was interested in a more detailed discusion and exposition of the processess which led up to the more important design decisions including the tiling ideas.<br>
                For example, how exactly did the patterns emerge and how were they then translated into the geometry of the actual spaces. What were the patterns?<br>
                What were the sequences?<br>
                I have also other quite specific questions, like what were the patterns which allowed the positioning of bedrooms on the street side for example.<br>
                I find your comments about the Upham house interesting and telling also. It's a far cry from the 400 year old courtyard which is still loved, and this is not necessarily a criticism of Alexander himself, but it is a tell tale sign of something. So what is it?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">It would be good to see some recent photos of the Upham house... I wonder if PL.com has thought of posting progress shots of buildings, it would be a good way of generating discussion.</font></p>

                I agree about doing tiles around the windows, budget permitting of course. Making tiles for any application lets you solve the "dutchman problem." I am amazed that people just accept "dutchmen" in tile installations. They are so used to accepting that tiles will not fit evenly in installations without partial cut tiles that even in expensive installations they don't insist on custom tiles being made to blend everything together more smoothly.</font>

He also recommended filling some units in apartment buildings with 3 feet of humus and planting trees that grow out the windows. He said these "tree tenants"(his term) would pay their rent by purifying the atmosphere and absorbing sound. These images first appeared in his paintings and later he carried them out for real. He thought of himself as a doctor for architecture to counteract modernist influences, which he felt were anti-life. (He was also an appreciator of the liveliness of the architecture in "slums.")<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I imagine that the relative success of roughness depends on its intent. The way I understand it, roughness comes about a) as natural consequence of paying attention to the unique configuration of existing centers and b) intentionally to soften the "brutal" rigidity of designed form, e.g. skyscraper windows. From Mr. Alexander's discussions of the tile layout in NOO 1 & 2, it seems the wall itself was the center being strengthened by the tiles, not the windows. He mentions gradients as the driving transformation here, not roughness. It seems the windows are strengthened by the empty space around them, perhaps void comming into play. So the roughness of the tiling pattern here is a consequence of keeping these voids equal size for uniquely positioned windows. I think the photo on page 295 shows this decision in better light than the photo on 287, because at this scale you can see that the gray area creates a better boundary for the window. I guess one would have to see the wall without the tiles before judging whether the tiles actually damage the windows as centers. I can see how choosing to lay the tiles to the very edges of the windows would have resulted in a "wallpaper" look, weakening the windows AND the walls as centers. Perhaps an even better solution would have been some more elaborate tile work surrounding the windows to give them a thicker membrane/boundary, but who knows, that could have blown the budget.</font>

                When I asked, "when is roughness too rough," I was thinking of the situation around the windows on the Julian Street building NOO 2 page 287. I think that CA might have thought it was OK to handle the pattern of squares around those windows that way by invoking the "roughness" principle. But this resolution is to me very unsatisfactory, (even though it was judged to be the better of two ideas during the working out of the design), because it is a poor "boundary" for the windows, one that cuts arbitrarily into "positive space" around the window. Or maybe another way to say it is that the windows are unneccessarily weak centers because they need a stronger border around them--as in the example of the borders around the doors of a Gothic Cathedral elsewhere in NOO, (can't find the page right now.)<br>
                I think that CA's designs tend to have decorative touches that are too rote, too "rubber-stamped" in their quality. That is to say, they need to have more variations in the parts as they go along, say, a wall. I know he is sensitive to this need and maybe it was just a budget limit on the project, but just as he advocates the charm of "aperiodic grid" in plan layout, a "periodic grid" or rubberstamp repitition of a geometric pattern or even the lily pattern on the Upham house is not life-producing, to my sense of it. The "every part unique" principle is being abandoned, at a big loss of life in such a case.<br>
                I took the opportunity to drive by the Upham house a few days ago to see it firsthand 12 years later. I thought it looked pretty good, but I was shocked by the state of the yard currently. The plants must have been pulled out, so the view from the street is a bunch of not-so-swell-looking pressure-treated wood walls, totally out of relationship to the house above in terms of color and degree of "life." I looked for the plum tree mentioned in the text as being a valuable center. To my dismay, I saw that it was surrounded by a medicre standard "suburban issue"wooden fence that looked about six feet high and was so close to the tree that under the tree seemed like a dark tunnel because the tree (now older and bigger) cut out all light from above and the wooden fence cut out the light from the side and eliminated the view of the neighbor's gardens. I don't know who built the fence, but it was terrible.I had the impression that the house had reached around the tree and clutched it and was trying to hoard it! Maybe the neighbors got pissed off and built it to spoil the view on purpose.I was puzzled because CA said they took into consideration the neighbor's garden as well, when they carved out the space. Whatever happened in the intervening years,the present situation has completely the opposite effect from the sweet little photo of the tree on page 580 book 2. Yikes!<br></font>

                Unfortunately it's not like knitting a jumper, once you finish it it's done... for better or worse, whether it has enough borders and voids or not.<br>
                With a jumper, you can easily tell... if theres a gaping hole somewhere, you see it and do something to repair it.<br>
                My own opinion at this stage is not to worry about it too much... at most, I stand back, squint my eyes and look at it through half closed,or half open eyes and say, yeah that looks like a 'field of centers', or a nice pattern atleast. At this stage this is the extent of my 'scientific' approach, squint at it!<br>
                At this stage, I'm still grappling with applying the patterns, and coming to terms with 'sequences'. So, I suppose in this respect, I'm a traditionalist and believe that if you apply the patterns, and sequences correctly, then its also likely there will be enough of the 15 principles present. Gauging the success of an applied set of patterns is easier for me than counting centers (I'm reading that sometimes there can be up to 40,000 of them).<br>
                This brings me again to my other question that I am interested in... about sequences and the application of patterns to actually existing structures, to an actually existing world largely going through what is commonly agreed to be a degenerative process in this period of human history.<br>
                If NOO talks about 'generative sequences', and PL's as being similar to that of genetic information, why do they not talk about the process of repair being akin to the immune system also... insofar as it takes the role of repairing degenerative processes?<br>
                Getting back to practical matters.<br>
                Most of my work, about 60-70% is working with existing buildings, and here I reckon that the process is subtly different to that of building from new. I can not describe how it is precisely different, but I would like to try.<br>
                1. Often you don't start from the largest patterns, but might start with the smaller ones<br>
                2.The process of demolition occupies the sequences very early on. This phenomenon to me feels different to the generative process of 'creating life', and I would say is closely related to the repairing process and the 'structure preserving' transformations. The activity of demolition however is rarely mentioned in CA's ideas, appart from his descriptions of it in natural processes, ie: the breaking of waves, collapsing of cylinders etc...<br>
                Indeed in some projects, the demolition process is sufficient in extent and nature to suffice for a greatly repaired situation. Anything more in these circumstances is imposing order. In this respect, I'm viewing the act of demolition or destruction as an act of 'building' also, or at least as generative/creative as the process of creation/ construction.</font>

                and you can see them as transformative actions.<br>
                Within the action mode, in applying each of these - create a border here, add a void there - you are to use the wholeness as your guide, right? My question is: When do you know when to stop? Is there a limit? Should there be a limit?<br>
                Can you over-apply the 15 transformations?<br>
