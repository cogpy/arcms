        <h4>Computer scientists are engaged in the design of software: objects considered more complex than any other human artifact. Because of the complexity of software, computer scientists have become interested in patterns, reusable configurations and pattern languages that allow novel situations to be addressed through new combinations of known elements.</h4>
        <p>Programming is one field where there is an interest and an ethic of sharing information, developing cumulative knowledge and pooling ideas to solve common problems. Computer scientists are also interested in the possibilities of slow piecemeal adaptations and in understanding the underlying geometry and aesthetics of "good" programs. There is an interest in explicitness of process, structure, and knowledge, and since computer scientists are <b>scientists</b>, they hold this very dear and find it inspiring and useful.</p>
        <p>We know that our methods and approaches stemming from our invention of patterns and pattern languages twenty-five years ago, was and is of great interest to computer programmers. The new material now being developed on this site -- which may perhaps be viewed as second generation of pattern languages -- will be of far greater interest to computer programmers.</p>
        <p>As a short introductory visit here are a few suggested links.</p>

        <p>As a member of the Pattern Language Association, you will have access to the full library of materials available, including:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>On line access to the 253 classic patterns with activated links between patterns- shown in the book, but not available as functioning hyperlinks until now. It changes the way you see the pattern language.</li>
          <li>All sequences, theory of sequences, and working versions of sequences for different scales of problem.</li>
          <li>Archive of unpublished papers, books, and pictures</li>
          <li>Discussion of ways that groups may use a single pattern language, or sequence, to work together on a collective problem</li>
          <li>On-line discussion among people who are trying to explore the actual sequences which work, thus exposing the idea of better and worse in a sequence, to empirical and logical clarification.</li>
          <li>In the long run, discussions about the ways that sequences and patterns in a sequence may be nested, and call upon each other</li>
          <li>Also long-run, a language builder which allows a person to create a generative sequence for a particular project, by operating on the pattern language, to obtain a coherent sequence.</li>
