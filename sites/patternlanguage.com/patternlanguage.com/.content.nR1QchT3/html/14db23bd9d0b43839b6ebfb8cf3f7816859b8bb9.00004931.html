            Subject: November 17th Question</font>
            <p><font color="#E3E5C9">Mr. Alexander: I was in Architecture School when "A Pattern Language" was first published and I was criticized by the faculty for proposing to follow the methods put forth in your work. After graduating and obtaining my license as an Architect the pursuit of a stable income has led me through a series of roles in the building business. I have been an Architect, Contractor, Developer, Facility Manager, and currently a Capital Projects Manager. In each of these roles I have witnessed first hand the miserable failure of the existing process to build and remodel buildings.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#E3E5C9">It feels to me that our society has climbed a mountain, the mountain of ugly and poor performing buildings. Now, you are on another mountain, the mountain of beautiful and timeless buildings. We can see you over there and some of us would like very much to climb your mountain. Our first problem is to descend from the ugly mountain we are on! We are tied to our ugly mountain by economic ropes and a network of institutional infrastructure.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#E3E5C9">For example, I am a leader on millions of dollars in construction spending at a conservative private university. This organization refuses to take the risk of following a new path. The Board and Administration do not see the failure of their current methods, they only see the need to quickly build new facilities to keep pace with the rapid change in the world around them.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#E3E5C9">To answer your question about how can the web site help: Give us a map leading to the bottom of the ugly mountain we have climbed. It will be much easier to use the tools and techniques you have discovered and developed if first we untie ourselves from the ropes of our existing infrastructure.</font></p>
            <p><font color="#E3E5C9">Thank You for your work. Despite my participation in the wrong process I am attracted to the new way you are leading . I hope I can find the courage and economic means to follow.</font></p>
