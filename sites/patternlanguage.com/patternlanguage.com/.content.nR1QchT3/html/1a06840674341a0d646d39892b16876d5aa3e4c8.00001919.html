          </center>
          <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
          <h3><font color="brown">Many old houses have narrow stairs. Even if the main stair of the house may have been wide, the back stairs were 2 feet wide; sometimes as little as 18 inches. Stairs to the attic or to a studio over the garage used to be 19", 21" wide, 23" wide. In small traditional Japanese houses many stairs are no more than 18 inches wide.</font></h3>
          <p><font color="brown">But the current UBC (national building code) has a fairly recently introduced provision which declares that all stairs, no matter what they are for, and no matter whether they are fire exits or not, must be 36 inches wide.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">It sounds like a small matter. But it costs Americans about $360 million per year -- one third of a billion dollars.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">To make a house which is reasonable in price, you have to make it small. Every square foot counts. Nowadays, even a house of 800 square feet is possible. But in such a house, a stair which is 3 feet wide is absurd. A typical stair is about 14 feet long. The stair then consumes an area which is 14 feet long, 3 feet wide, and two stories high -- a total of 84 square feet of construction, costing (at $70/sf, say) about $6000 of construction volume. .</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Many of these houses could be made with a staircase that is 27 inches wide -- so what is being wasted is 9 inches of width, 16 feet long, 2 stories high -- a total of 24 square feet. At a construction price of $70/sf, (average), this is $1680 of waste, for this one little item. A $1680 which most people do not have, and are not gladly throwing out of the window.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">There are 2,000,000 houses being built per year. Some are apartments, many are single story houses. But let's say that 10% of them are two-story (it is probably more). That means that 200,000 stairs are being built to an unnecessary width, only because of the code. This represents $1680*200,000 = $336 million. It is $336,000,000 of money wasted. This huge amount is wasted on this one tiny and largely pointless item.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Of course the insurance companies and construction industry will argue that it is necessary to protect people in fires. Arguable, except in very rare cases? And if one life per year were saved by this safety measure, that one life would cost $360,000,000. Meanwhile, twenty million American families are being damaged by this rule.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">When you think it out carefully, there are really too parts to the 3' rule in the code. First there is the rule that a stair must be 36 wide if it is part of a required fire exit path. This rule has some little bit of common sense to it. Maybe. But the other part of the rule, which is the way the rule now is, requires that every single stair (unless it leads only to a bit of equipment -- a very rare case) must be 36 wide. This part is really crazy. It has no rhyme or reason. But it is in the Uniform Building Code; so it has to be followed.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">It is not harmless. Many of us are trying to build houses for people who don't have much money. As most readers probably know, nowadays even a young professional family with a good salary, often can't afford a house. And why? It is, in part, because of wasteful nonsense like this.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Might it not make sense to call for review of this staircase provision and for other provisions that are similarly wasteful -- and to propose a series of exceptions which would allow certain parts of the building code to be eliminated as exceptions, when the house builder or house owner agrees to it and when the house is being built for someone who isn't a Texas millionaire. Isn't it shameful to be doing this, at a time when millions of families can't buy a house?</font></p>
