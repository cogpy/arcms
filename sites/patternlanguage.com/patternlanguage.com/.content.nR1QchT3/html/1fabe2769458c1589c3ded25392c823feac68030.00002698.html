  <p><font color="white" face="arial">INPUT: Neighborhoods need more focal points, of common use. There are many small unused and neglected pieces of land within the City. The City wants to support local stewardship to increase the life of the City. to improve communal places where everyone has a right to go. The City has a willingness to support the process administratively, and may on occasion also help with a few hundred dollars in matching funds.<br></font></p>
  <p><font color="white" face="arial">OUTPUT: This process generates the start of a small green forming a nucleus in a neighborhood that is capable of helping communal life.</font></p>

  <h1><i>To identify spots which have the potential for being such a place, drive around the neighborhood, looking for a small area of public land that can be improved by active stewardship and that they have a reason to care about.</i></h1>
  <p><i>It could be a piece of street which has no use, near a street barrier; It could be a blighted empty lot in the neighborhood, a weedy corner where two streets meet, a meadow in a public park, an edge of a stream, part of an urban forest, a rocky outcrop, a place where there is a beautiful view of the Bay, a trail behind houses. It needs to be small, could be no more than 40 feet square.</i></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100">3. FIND A PLACE WITH OTHER PEOPLE</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <h1><i>If you begin to see some possibilities, take one or two other neighbors with you, to see if you can arrive at a consensus about the best place to start.</i></h1>
  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100">4. CENTRAL POSITION</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <h1><i>As far as possible, and if you have any choice in the matter, choose a piece of land which is in a place which people see, and come by every day, so that they could imagine seeing other people there.</i></h1>
  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100">5. ESTABLISH THE POSSIBILITY OF STEWARDSHIP</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <h1><i>Establish that, in principle, potentially, this place can be owned or managed by the neighborhood. To do so call the Berkeley hotline, 555-1234. If city land, you will find out how it might be done; if private neglected land, the program will be identified in one of the two programs which the city offers (see footnote).</i></h1>

  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100"></font></p>
  <h1><i>With some of your neighbors, spend some time there and find the main centers of the land. Look for its natural borders, its principal features and strengths. Note its major trees, flora, aspect, sunlight and shade, and probable water flows. What now detracts from these strengths? How might it be improved?</i></h1>

  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100">9. A SEAT IN THE SUN</font></p>
  <p></p>

  <p></p>
  <h1><i>Begin a program of establishing at least one tree, at least one bush, at least one group of wildflowers, and at least one seat. The flora can be chosen from the following list (note a) and may be obtained from (note b)</i></h1>
  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100">8. LEARN ABOUT YOUR LOCAL FLORA</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <h1><i>Every Jepson Place will be unique, but the local flora will often be what makes it especially belong in your city. As stewards of a Jepson Place, you must learn about your flora, or engage consultants to help with plant and weed identification, on each site.</i></h1>
  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100">9. PLEDGE A LITTLE MONEY OR WORK <a href="javascript:newWindow('jep2.jpg','window2')"><img src="pic3.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p>
  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100"></font></p>
  <h1><i>Once a few people have identified a place you would like to work, pledge to contribute money or work - perhaps $100 or ten hours of work each year -- to create A Jepson Place.[The City of Berkeley will consider providing grants up to $500 to match these private contributions each year.]</i></h1>
  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100">10. SECURE PERMISSION TO WORK</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <h1><i>Once the site is selected and studied, and some commitments of work and money secured, a written proposal to create a neighborhood green should be made to the property owner or responsible agency. If the land is City property, write your Councilmember to initiate the process.</i></h1>

  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100"></font></p>
  <h1><i>Start with the obvious things: pick up trash, cut and pull weeds. As weeds are managed, preserve the native California flora already on the site, encourage it by allowing native bunchgrasses and flowers to go to seed each year, by spreading the seeds, by propagation at home, and perhaps purchase of locally appropriate plants from the California Native Plant Society Nursery in Tilden Park. If brush and tree cover are excessive, gradually thin and reduce these stands, taking special care to preserve animal habitats and to be mindful of how these major vegetation centers contribute to the beauty of the place.</i></h1>
  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100">12. GET HELP FROM GARDENERS OR FROM PEOPLE WITH POWER EQUIPMENT <a href="javascript:newWindow('howard.jpg','window2')"><img src="pic3.jpg" border="0"></a></font></p>

  <h1><i>Make each place positive. That means, give each important part, some substance as a place, with a definite shape, with a level surface, with an edge, perhaps, with a center, with a boundary, with a view and a connection to some larger place. The very first place that should be made positive, is the place where you are building the seat. If you make that positive, it will get the project going.</i></h1>

  <p></p>
  <h1><i>Apply for subsidy which will provide matching funds for funds and labor provided by neighbors.</i></h1>
  <p><font size="3" color="#FF1100">9. HAND OVER TO THE PARKS DEPARTMENT</font></p>
  <p></p>
  <h1><i>Make an arrangement that the place will be taken over by the city under the progam mentioned (note above). Not only ownership but maintenance are to be guaranteed. Follow the city procedure to do this.</i></h1>
