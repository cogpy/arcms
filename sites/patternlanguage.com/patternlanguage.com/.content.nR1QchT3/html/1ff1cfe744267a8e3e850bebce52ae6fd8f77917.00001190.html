                Sorry I don't have a digital yet or I would email you the Upham pics. That would actually be a fun thing to do here, play "what has more life" with sets of pictures that people could comment on. Because you are right about needing something to help bring the consideration out of abstaction, as CA does so wonderfully with his illustrations and reports of his personal feelings.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">About "style merchants" I guess "they are always with us"...at least in good old capitalist totalitarian society. (If anyone among you has not tried to sell anything based on style in the last thirty days you may cast the first stone!) I read an interesting report in Metropolis about graphic design in East Germany after the Wall came down. The biz just exploded because the packaging was all generic under communism and when they started competing they needed new packaging! So, I'm not worried if people want to bring APL to bear in spec housing development. Jeez, have at it! How could we do any worse? I once lived in an Eichler house, which had, as I think most if not all of them did, an enclosed courtyard!! (Eichler was a creative spec builder in the SF Bay Area in the Fifties. I just saw a book about Eichler so I guess he is getting known.)<br>
                As for folks using sequences, when CA and Co have some to sell...I'm thinking of buying one for my house project. Right now they say they are only 10% finished with the house sequence, which they will sell for $50, and for $2000 when it is complete in about a year they say. So I just finished reading the description of the Upham House, trying to glean some rough insight from that, which reflects 12 years ago's thinking, and I did get a rough idea...also, from his description of helping his student learn how to design by feeling-figuring out the most important thing, drawing it, the next most important thing, draw it...etc. I assume that is the simple essence of it. The simple essence is mock it up as big as you can, feel it, shift it around in relationship to other parts until the whole assembly lives and doesn't trip on itself and irritate you, and build it.<br>
                CA says people didn't seem to be able to use APL successfully on their own, and he's on sequences as the solution to that. His arguments about the number of errors in the average house and what they actually cost are really interesting, and explains to me why my intuition regarded so many houses as actually being worth negative! (OK... I'll take that quitclaim deed, if you insist!)Hence the value of his sequences approach, which is supposed to allow one to walk along "Alexander's Razor" and miss all the gazillions of potential wrong turns on your way "home." I'll buy that, in theory.<br>
                But basically I think CA is just presenting a brilliant comprehensive argument for the primacy of feeling as the ultimate arbiter in building decisions. That feeling has a universal, "populist dimension" in that anyone can "feel it" for themselves, and it also has an elitist, esoteric dimension--not everyone can pull "Rhapsody In Blue" out of the ether, but when someone does, we can mostly all recognize it and value it as special. CA SORT OF says, follow the sequences I'm going to show you, and you'll get "Rhapsody In Blue"--you can reason out a method to get to inspiration. He also realizes that feeling sensitivity develops with practice, AND that something was going on in that old temple site in Japan where he had that "staged-pre-designed" meeting with the dragonfly that is beyond his present understanding and that is NOT available to be inspected with his thinking mind. Nor can he package and sell that capacity. The most he could do is find out what the practice there was and IF there is a Master available who can transmit it to him If he is willing to meet the requirements of that practice. It is a conceit of the Westerm DIY mentality that Inspiration is reducible to a recipe that the ego can simply grab and appropriate.<br>
                Creativity, Originality, Inspiration... these matters are profoundly esoteric.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">As for the art vs. eggs and steak, it's always interesting, isn't it? As for me, my tastes are simple, I only want the best. (quote Mae West I think) I'm only interested in doing unique, very high-end work for clients who also only want and can afford the best, so that is what I do. Yes, every tile is a plate of steak and eggs, and from a very expensive restaurant, to boot. That's good. If you make them pay more, they appreciate it more!<br></font></p>

                I have a number of concerns about applying the 15 principles:<br>
                1. The emergence of 'style' merchants<br>
                2. It becoming a cosmetic treatment<br>
                3. That ordinary people will never make meaningful application of them, for various reasons (ie: budget being one amongst many others).<br>
                4. As they are abstract, it becomes incredibly difficult to apply them and to discuss them... particularly as they become detached from real experience the discussion invariably can entail an endless scenario of 'what if' possibilities, all quite arbitrary from the actual life generating circumstances.<br>
                5. Because of their abstract nature, their ability to stand alone as principles'they will lend themselves to being seperated from patterns theory and in this sense can be as potentially damaging as many other 20th C ideas. (I'm probably totally wrong, but I'll keep playing the devils advocate here).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My criticism is this, that each one of those tiles would roughly be equivelant to a plate full of steak and eggs. But I'm not necessarily saying that we don't need art and we only live on bread alone.<br>
                In the Julian Sreet Inn I was interested in a more detailed discusion and exposition of the processess which led up to the more important design decisions including the tiling ideas.<br>
                For example, how exactly did the patterns emerge and how were they then translated into the geometry of the actual spaces. What were the patterns?<br>
                What were the sequences?<br>
                I have also other quite specific questions, like what were the patterns which allowed the positioning of bedrooms on the street side for example.<br>
                I find your comments about the Upham house interesting and telling also. It's a far cry from the 400 year old courtyard which is still loved, and this is not necessarily a criticism of Alexander himself, but it is a tell tale sign of something. So what is it?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">It would be good to see some recent photos of the Upham house... I wonder if PL.com has thought of posting progress shots of buildings, it would be a good way of generating discussion.</font></p>

                I agree about doing tiles around the windows, budget permitting of course. Making tiles for any application lets you solve the "dutchman problem." I am amazed that people just accept "dutchmen" in tile installations. They are so used to accepting that tiles will not fit evenly in installations without partial cut tiles that even in expensive installations they don't insist on custom tiles being made to blend everything together more smoothly.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">It seems to me that windows are a really great opportunity to beautify buildings, sadly, nearly always a missed chance.<br>
                Hundertwasser advocated "window rights"-- which he defined as any tenant's right to decorate the exterior wall around his or her window as far as the length of the tenant's arm. He also recommended filling some units in apartment buildings with 3 feet of humus and planting trees that grow out the windows. He said these "tree tenants"(his term) would pay their rent by purifying the atmosphere and absorbing sound. These images first appeared in his paintings and later he carried them out for real. He thought of himself as a doctor for architecture to counteract modernist influences, which he felt were anti-life. (He was also an appreciator of the liveliness of the architecture in "slums.")<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I imagine that the relative success of roughness depends on its intent. The way I understand it, roughness comes about a) as natural consequence of paying attention to the unique configuration of existing centers and b) intentionally to soften the "brutal" rigidity of designed form, e.g. skyscraper windows. From Mr. Alexander's discussions of the tile layout in NOO 1 & 2, it seems the wall itself was the center being strengthened by the tiles, not the windows. He mentions gradients as the driving transformation here, not roughness. It seems the windows are strengthened by the empty space around them, perhaps void comming into play. So the roughness of the tiling pattern here is a consequence of keeping these voids equal size for uniquely positioned windows. I think the photo on page 295 shows this decision in better light than the photo on 287, because at this scale you can see that the gray area creates a better boundary for the window. I guess one would have to see the wall without the tiles before judging whether the tiles actually damage the windows as centers. I can see how choosing to lay the tiles to the very edges of the windows would have resulted in a "wallpaper" look, weakening the windows AND the walls as centers. Perhaps an even better solution would have been some more elaborate tile work surrounding the windows to give them a thicker membrane/boundary, but who knows, that could have blown the budget.</font>

                When I asked, "when is roughness too rough," I was thinking of the situation around the windows on the Julian Street building NOO 2 page 287. I think that CA might have thought it was OK to handle the pattern of squares around those windows that way by invoking the "roughness" principle. But this resolution is to me very unsatisfactory, (even though it was judged to be the better of two ideas during the working out of the design), because it is a poor "boundary" for the windows, one that cuts arbitrarily into "positive space" around the window. Or maybe another way to say it is that the windows are unneccessarily weak centers because they need a stronger border around them--as in the example of the borders around the doors of a Gothic Cathedral elsewhere in NOO, (can't find the page right now.)<br>
                I think that CA's designs tend to have decorative touches that are too rote, too "rubber-stamped" in their quality. That is to say, they need to have more variations in the parts as they go along, say, a wall. I know he is sensitive to this need and maybe it was just a budget limit on the project, but just as he advocates the charm of "aperiodic grid" in plan layout, a "periodic grid" or rubberstamp repitition of a geometric pattern or even the lily pattern on the Upham house is not life-producing, to my sense of it. The "every part unique" principle is being abandoned, at a big loss of life in such a case.<br>
                I took the opportunity to drive by the Upham house a few days ago to see it firsthand 12 years later. I thought it looked pretty good, but I was shocked by the state of the yard currently. The plants must have been pulled out, so the view from the street is a bunch of not-so-swell-looking pressure-treated wood walls, totally out of relationship to the house above in terms of color and degree of "life." I looked for the plum tree mentioned in the text as being a valuable center. To my dismay, I saw that it was surrounded by a medicre standard "suburban issue"wooden fence that looked about six feet high and was so close to the tree that under the tree seemed like a dark tunnel because the tree (now older and bigger) cut out all light from above and the wooden fence cut out the light from the side and eliminated the view of the neighbor's gardens. I don't know who built the fence, but it was terrible.I had the impression that the house had reached around the tree and clutched it and was trying to hoard it! Maybe the neighbors got pissed off and built it to spoil the view on purpose.I was puzzled because CA said they took into consideration the neighbor's garden as well, when they carved out the space. Whatever happened in the intervening years,the present situation has completely the opposite effect from the sweet little photo of the tree on page 580 book 2. Yikes!<br></font>

                Unfortunately it's not like knitting a jumper, once you finish it it's done... for better or worse, whether it has enough borders and voids or not.<br>
                With a jumper, you can easily tell... if theres a gaping hole somewhere, you see it and do something to repair it.<br>
                My own opinion at this stage is not to worry about it too much... at most, I stand back, squint my eyes and look at it through half closed,or half open eyes and say, yeah that looks like a 'field of centers', or a nice pattern atleast. At this stage this is the extent of my 'scientific' approach, squint at it!<br>
                At this stage, I'm still grappling with applying the patterns, and coming to terms with 'sequences'. So, I suppose in this respect, I'm a traditionalist and believe that if you apply the patterns, and sequences correctly, then its also likely there will be enough of the 15 principles present. Gauging the success of an applied set of patterns is easier for me than counting centers (I'm reading that sometimes there can be up to 40,000 of them).<br>
                This brings me again to my other question that I am interested in... about sequences and the application of patterns to actually existing structures, to an actually existing world largely going through what is commonly agreed to be a degenerative process in this period of human history.<br>
                If NOO talks about 'generative sequences', and PL's as being similar to that of genetic information, why do they not talk about the process of repair being akin to the immune system also... insofar as it takes the role of repairing degenerative processes?<br>
                Getting back to practical matters.<br>
                Most of my work, about 60-70% is working with existing buildings, and here I reckon that the process is subtly different to that of building from new. I can not describe how it is precisely different, but I would like to try.<br>
                1. Often you don't start from the largest patterns, but might start with the smaller ones<br>
                2.The process of demolition occupies the sequences very early on. This phenomenon to me feels different to the generative process of 'creating life', and I would say is closely related to the repairing process and the 'structure preserving' transformations. The activity of demolition however is rarely mentioned in CA's ideas, appart from his descriptions of it in natural processes, ie: the breaking of waves, collapsing of cylinders etc...<br>
                Indeed in some projects, the demolition process is sufficient in extent and nature to suffice for a greatly repaired situation. Anything more in these circumstances is imposing order. In this respect, I'm viewing the act of demolition or destruction as an act of 'building' also, or at least as generative/creative as the process of creation/ construction.</font>

                and you can see them as transformative actions.<br>
                Within the action mode, in applying each of these - create a border here, add a void there - you are to use the wholeness as your guide, right? My question is: When do you know when to stop? Is there a limit? Should there be a limit?<br>

                Regarding your first point, I would say that your letter has more life than many so far and the practical value of this is that you have "enlivened" the proceedings here. To me, the constant tacit fact about human beings is that they are always interested in more life and always chose that direction if they can discern which way it lies. Thus there is nothing MORE PRACTICAL than this matter.<br>
                Your experience with the question seems the same as CA's--he seems to have run into alot of opposition at Berkeley, for instance, when he used the question to "empirically" show his students, "measured" by inspecting their own HEART-FEELING (and what a taboo there is against that!) that modernism had become an emperor who had no clothes.<br>
                Incidently, another great innovator that got bounced out of there (UC) was Henry Schaeffer-Simmern, author of "The Unfolding of Artistic Activity" because he had the temerity to suggest that Abstract Expressionist painting (which at that time was sweeping the art world such that ,one by one, all the other members of the faculty dropped what they were doing and became "Abstract Expressionists") was not art, because art was not "self-expression." Rather, it might more aptly be called "Self-expression." And I notice that in his attempt to explain his method of finding his way to and through sequences of decisions CA is resorting to Buddhist, including specifically Zen Buddhist, language. Zen is a tradition of Transmission outside of what we call mind. So, while we can have interesting discussions about this empiricism of the feeling sense, it probably will not reduce itself to a form that can be completely corralled, roped, and tied by word-based Cartesian logic. It is very taboo to suggest this, so in vol. 1 of NoO CA makes a big point of showing very clearly that he is a great respector and practioner of the mathematical-scientific approach to the investigation of Reality. BUT, he very respectfully shows why he has to step beyond it to account for and cure the psychosis he sees in architecture of the last fifty years.<br>
                As to the practical value of CA's work to anyone designing and making anything, it seems to me obvious. Consider a simple song "I want To Hold Your Hand" by The Beatles. When this song appeared it was utterly simple, utterly original, and utterly electrifying. It swept the market and made the musicians celebrities almost overnight. If you do creative work, you are interested in tapping What that song tapped. And if you do, you will win the Pritzker? Award very soon. And you will succeed in releasing profoundly beneficial enlivening energy into the world. I think what CA is doing is presenting information that will enable that, big-time.</font>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Chris,</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have been reading the NOO book two,and yes there are quite a number of issues about practicality that I would be interested in... after all, as you point out,whats the purpose of the theory?<br>
                I'll also be willing to play the devils advocate, or the village idiot, and ask or raise some issues which might be obvious to many, so please excuse my ignorance and the dumb questions.<br>
                I was just thinking today, that I'm still not convinced about the NOO books, at the danger of making an ignorant and hasty judgement (at the same time I do think they are remarkable and I have been bowled over by them in many ways so far. I'm also still wondering whether the PL are better in some ways).<br>
                1. About 'life'. Someone a little while ago raised the point on this site about the question Alexander asks about 'what has most life?'. I was struck by this question, of Alexanders... its simplicity, its directness, its obviousness, its power.<br>
                I am therefore interested in this question itself (amongst many others). What potential does this question have in practicality?<br>
                At one stage, i nearly divided the office i used to work in. I asked the question, in a very similar way Alexander asks it in his book, over a series of photographs i had taken around the office and the neighbourhood.<br>
                At another stage, i turned clients around with by asking the question, who were nearly going to make what i thought was going to be a stupid decision about their house plan. It managed with a single stroke, so to speak, to break a long impasse, particularly over some issues about aesthetics and style we had been discussing for a while.<br>
                2.About sequences. I still haven't seen any sequences for actually existing buildings. How do they work here?<br>
                Most of the examples are about from scratch building and design. Is there a chasm in the theory between 're-building the earth' and the actual content, focus and actual applicability of sequences.<br>
                In relation to this issue, i still fail to see the major step forward from PL, which at the outset make it clear that patterns, in a pattern language are themselves ordered (ie: from largest to smallest etc...)<br>
                3. About patterns. Part of this question has a more philosophical aspect, and that is the empirical nature of patterns, and infact, much of the theory of PL and NOO, seems to have empiricism as one of its backbones... or at least this seems to be one of the legitimising factors for patterns.<br>
                What about patterns that don't have empirical validation or evidence?<br>
                4. Modularisation. I recently worked with a firm (using PL methodology) who I thought definitely had an aspect of modularisation. This seems strange to me. Another related example is 'off the shelf' plans, which PL themselves offer for sale. How are these reconciled with PL methodology, particularly in terms of generating site specific, culturally responsive buildings and environments, or with the 'step by step' approach.<br>
                5. The 'unfolding process' of the internet?<br>
                How has this website influenced the natural, 'unfolding process' of a lively discussion and debate. (sorry to bark on old ground with this one).<br>
                I might be totally wrong, but it strikes me, that may the dynamics, or the dialectic between this site and its users be rendering a discussion, perceived and described by yourself as just idle in terms of making concrete and practical steps towards changing, or 're-building' the world. (this is by no means an attempt at isolation and levelling of critism at users... more a point about the form influencing the content. This is not so strange since NOO, unlike the TWOB or PL, starts with geometry, whereas the earlier books started with patterns).<br>
                6. Education. I liked your earlier idea about running PL workshops. It also strikes me that there is no resource or directed attempt to teach people how to write, or collect patterns. To me, being able to apply and invent relevant and current pattern languages for people and communities, architects, designers, builders, anyone interested in using Pl as a process should know how to write patterns.</font></p>

                Thanks for the lead on the article, I enjoyed it, although I enjoy CA's critiques alot more for their radical "beyond Cartesian" depth and range of examples from art. I find CA's analysis to be extremely wide-ranging and at the same time so profound that it moves me more to contemplation than to discussion. I think his strengths as a "noticer" and "understander" are wonderfully developed, more so than his abilities as a "generator" when it comes to beauty. I am so glad he is on the side of the good guys! His notion of transforming the totalitarian democratric grip on building processes by introducing snippable genes for better ideas that can slowly gain piecemeal acceptance is the first hope I have had in many years that the ugliness and feelinglessness ruling architecture can be overcome.<br>
                What interests me personally right now is understanding the nature of the "roughness" property. When is rough too rough and when is the design not rough enough? I find Islamic designs usually unsatisfactory because their geometric quality is too precise. (Although their use of calligraphy in architecture is a good counterfoil.)I love it when a geometric design "swims" a little bit--as in what CA calls an "aperiodic grid." There is an amazing book called "Who'd a Thought It?" about Afro-American quilts by Eli Leon. He only collects quilts that have improvisational play in their patterning. Such quilts have "life" to a high degree as CA discusses so well. In Architecture, the work of Josep Maria Jujol, who was Gaudi's assistant but an artist-engineer-architect in his own right, shows me tremendous life. I am studying CA and Jujol together to help me understand Beauty better. It's late, gotta go, hope this advances the effort of getting a little interchange going, or at least mutual offering of leads we may find illuminating...<br></font>

                Now that there is a look up, turn around, grinner, pal.<br>
                I worked alongside No Leak for a good spell now, it pleases me to say. You hit it right when you mentioned the discipline thing, always seems a natural effortless part of his way. Me, I struggle, and juggle, but 'ol Pete is what you'd call easy with it. His tool kit is always tidy and clean in them two well-worn carry bags, and he's somehow got the right fitting 'n pipe dope right there, when we need it.<br>
                But the one I really like is how he hand washes his coupla pair of wool socks every night or two and hangs 'em up to dry under that little back porch overhang.<br>
                So far as the plumbin' goes, near as I can make out for him it's some kinda reverance or pride for what the wall of the pipe can do. Sometimes if you get him goin just right he'll talk about the miracle of seperatin' two worlds, or one world servin the needs of another, or sumpthin' suchlike.<br>
                I don't quite see it yet myself, like he does, but he don't dwell on it long, mainly he's happy bein' good at plumbin'.</font>

                The Gradient.<br>
                Why is there always polarity?<br>
                Oh, everything in Nature is a gradient. Gradient is one of those forms we need to consider-like symetry.<br>
                In fact one of the forms of symetry would be a gradient.<br>
                Nature uses the gradient everyplace, its how simple things become complex, how indeterminate things become rigorous, or how young things become old, see, the gradient theme is throughout Nature.<br>
                And the gradient is not an escaladient. It can be utilized in an escaladient but it is not the concept of an escaladient.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">You can have a gradient fron the simple to the complex, from the less to the more intelligent if you will.<br>
                The gradient has two seemingly finite ends, taken in time it shows what exists, but it is essentially a report.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The escaladient on the other hand is dynamic, it must have innovation within it. Innovation in a gradient would be fatal. It would destroy it.<br>
                The escaladient aims at being, the gradient is only part of the process. But it is one of the key structures of nature-The Gradient.<br>
                Alexander sees it, from his vantage point, and describes it well. It's not a tough one to get agreement on, and works as a good non-threatening lead to more meaningful underlying structures.</font></p>

                You mentioned Bernard Maybeck awhile back. I heard a story that he was once asked about his opinion of the work of a certain modernist architect, I forget which one, and he responded, "Those boxes? That's not architecture. Architecture is an Art!"<br>
                I just saw a movie that I think would be of interest to No Leak Pete. It's called "Ghengis Blues" and is about a blind musician who teaches himself to throat-sing like they do in Tibet and is invited to Tuva to sing in a contest. There is one scene where they show an animal being killed and butchered for a feast, and how the Tuvan people do it without spilling any of the blood on the ground out of respect for the Life Force in the blood. I wonder whether No Leak has a similar discipline with respect to plumbing?</font>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have been following this delightful forum for a couple of days now and reading past parts to glean as much insight as possible from the interesting comments. I am an admirer of CA's work, currently reading the second volume of NOO, but read APL and some other works before. I am just about to have a chance to apply it on a house-building project (land is in escrow). I am always on the lookout for contributers to culture like CA so I particularly enjoy the chance to interact with people who also see the value and hear what else they are tuning in to. For example, these comments about Geomancy and temple-making and the profundities of the ultimate aims of architecture as it can creatively support Spiritual Life. I completely resonate with CA's desire to unerstand: how do you make something BEAUTIFUL. And with his inspired enquiry "which of these pictures feels to you that it has more life." EXACTLY! BRAVO! And I celebrate the usefulness of his language about "centers," and the 15 properties, and now "sequences." I would like to point to other contributers that I find useful/inspiring also, so far, and hope others can point me toward more: Antoni Gaudi, Josep Maria Jujol, Henry Shaeffer-Simmern<br>
                (wrote The Unfolding of Artistic Activity), Adi Da Samraj, Hundertwasser.<br>
                I have one technical question/observation: there is a man in Arizona who has come up with a technique he calls "cast earth" in which he adds plaster to soil and retards the hardening process long enough to be able to pour an entire building shell at once. I like the looks of the finished wall alot but he is not making his process available to the small-scale user, he is going in the other direction. I would love to see if I could use a similar process small-scale, letting the stuff harden as I went in small batches, (sort of like the rammed earth/pise technique where they have a pretty small form that they move frequently instead of a large one that they do the whole wall at one time.) That's on my wish list If anyone has some ideas about it I'd love to hear.<br>

                Inside the massive wooden doors is a series of pavillions and couryards, lined on both sides by residential and administrative halls. The inner complex can be compact or vast, consisting of hundreds of buildings or a small handful.<br>
                The temple architecture is virtually identical regardless of the religion practiced within. Variations in style are a product of region and historical period, not the dictates of faith.<br>
                The main support consists of interlocking wooden beams and enormous columns resting on raised platforms. The curving roof is paved in ceramic tiles. In southern China elaborate ornamentation and increasingly upturned eaves became the fashion. In the north temple architecture remained more restrained.<br></font>

I enjoyed page 1 this morning after your post piqued my curiousity, wide ranging in scope and penetrating some nice specifics. An instructive archive!</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Regarding the "bad" patterns, I will say that most of them fall into catagories regarding responses to fear, (in)security, privacy, liability, ownership, ostentation, percieved financial realities (building for resale, one example), laziness, conformity; in short, a sampling of the forces which stifle imagination and innovation.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In defense of all this it must be remembered how nature and culture both instruct us early and forcefully what a hard order we are up against here and how we must survive and look out for ourselves. That means learning the rules and playing the game, in all it's aspects, questioning the way it works is always tricky.(hence: "No Backyard???")</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The good news is innovation is irrepressible and will find a way, that's it's job, and that is nature operating the only way she knows how.<br>
                She holds it here sure, doing the safe proven thing, but she also makes certain there are guys like us on the site here who are interested in how some of the "why not?", and "what if?", stuff might fit in as well.<br>

                Yes, only a little in Australia. Lots of information around about it but not much experience using it.<br>
                My limited experience of it is that its labour intensive, particularly the rendering part. The bales can go up quickly but you have to watch out for lateral stability, as well as detailing around doors and windows. There is also the issue of load bearing or infill... load bearing is difficult, bales need to have great consistency in compactness, moisture content, particular straw should be used etc...<br>
                The general consensus down here seems to be it is particularly good for:<br>
                Rural situations where the bales are availabe and dont have to be transported long distances<br>
                Good for extremely cold and extremely hot climates<br>
                The bales have infinte insulation and no thermal mass, therefore around here they are often used as external walls<br>
                Not good for:<br>
                Damp climates<br>
                Urban buildings as the bales take up too much space.<br>
                I think they require more specialisation and experience than is thought.<br>
                Since the introduction of straw bale down here, there have been other 'straw' based waste products also, such as straw board panels. These are used as an internal cladding, much easier and faster to use.<br>
                Very early on I talked about my experience of how bad 'patterns' are so persistent in our culture.<br>
                I have had some more recent experiences and was wondering what others do about them.<br>
                The particular pattern I am talking about is 'Backyards'.<br>
                Just recently I completed a house design with clients, fairly young, in which we used many of CA's patterns... starting off with the major ones of siting, locating gardens in the best, sunniest positions, working through circulation realms and main room positions etc... The product was a great design. We also used some patterns that we invented ourselves, such as 'south facing outdoors', which is shade.<br>
                One day, the clients came to me after talking to friends and family, showing off their design we had made, and were told by people that they had no 'backyard'. Ofcoarse, they did have a backyard, but the point is it was not in the usual place, opposite in direction to the front yard, or directly behind the home. It was instead along the side of the home, on the sunny side.<br>
                This realisation was so powerfull, that all of a sudden the clients forgot much of the previous process and now were fixated on the problem of 'not having their Backyard'. The pattern of the backyard, like many other patterns, is so consistently repeated and deeply ingrained and entrehched as a pattern, that it pulls extremely hard, away from what I understand this 'unfolding process' to be, or away from people to do naturally what they should. I realise that this is no revelation to anyone here. But I am interested to know if there are any others who have had similar experiences with 'bad patterns' and what these patterns are.<br>
                I don't mean to divert attention from the current trajectory of the discussions, but I find that these more mundane everyday problems do not leave me free enough to think about the next level of discussion.</font>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Thanks for the related sites Chris, it's good to know there is some kindred discussion around.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Your question kicks it good. I'll take a quick shot at it hoping that we'll get some follow up. I'm sure as poser of the query you will elaborate on it,(smile).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">"Structure preserving process", may be another way to say, "order which endures and evolves". If we start looking at the built and natural environment this way, as Alexander has, the mystery of what underlies and holds it together is the natural next waypoint. Visualize Logic as an agent actively scrutinizing Order for inefficiencies as it evolves, and slowly weeding them out. "Order by trial and error is just as good as Order by dictum." It takes time out of mind, but there seems to have been enough.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I submit to you that an event is not just the measurable wieghing and measuring of a change as we all agree. I assert that along with this, an event(or object) is also a tightly knotted analgam of esthetic and ethical readouts as well as the easily seen physical mechanistic evidence.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">This is a key point, largely unseen, even by Alexander, but when one finally grasps that nature is set up this way, everything becomes threefold deeper and we begin to be able to read the Order for ethically helpful content, not just physically empowering facts, or disconnected beauty.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Let me digress slightly, sorry. The point is that any latent center with the power to raise conciousness is not some esoteric secret, it is only a lead to the realization that we are nature's best accomplishment on the road to extending and elaborating the capability of feeling, imagination, and critical interpretation. Evolution flows into all the niches and nature doesn't play favorites ,she's after what we've got at the moment , but don't kid yourself, the dry chip is coming right along now (with our help), and you can bet the amount of nurture and energy expenditure is compareable to what was lavished on every other part of the word which succeeds, including ourselves.<br>
                It helps to anthropomorphize sometimes: "Nature is insanely proud of, and jealously guards the intelligence of a gnat."</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Ironically' I think the "latent center" you speak of is not a center at all in the Alexanderan sense. The next most powerful dicovery which seems to be in progress now as we discuss these ideas is the realization of the connectedness of all things, and dawning awareness of the boundary controls that become visible (and debilitating) as the systems are pushed to maximum saturation or maximum extraction. This bumping up against the edge is getting our attention now and in the next couple of centuries will force our attention back toward your latent centers which have been lost, forgotten, or never before found.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Myth will not do it this time. The noble values of our Buddha, Christ, Mohammed, Great Spirit, and all the rest will not be lost, they will be more powerful and secure than ever because these values will flow directly from the content of nature itself, once we learn to read her intent and meaning.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">And learn it we will, or it's curtains for humanity.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Your question remains, I realize, and a damn good one it is.</font></p>

                Would CES be interested in setting up a small variety of workshops ranging from weekends to week-long courses at certain times during the year?<br>
                (Go ahead and charge a honest fee.) Present an opportunity for those that would be interested in learning first-hand the reality of an living, breathing unfolding process. Ah, so this is what it's like. Okay, I've got the basics down. Now I can try to practice back in my hometown.<br>
                Or better yet, maybe CES should form a 'branch' that tours the country giving workshops at those building expos you hear about every so often at the local convention centers.<br>
                Get the word out, in action.<br>
                Or crazy idea, use the tools of mass marketing - television(HGTV?), heaven forbid, to display the actions of unfolding process as it's understood at this moment.<br>
                I think these NoO concepts speak of deep truths. And I think it would only help its purpose to place this boat in the mainstream.</font>
