  <h1>PREFACE</h1>
  <p>This document contains the backbone of a historic and visionary attempt to bring a beautiful city to order.</p>
  <p>In May 1987, the City Board of the City of Pasadena voted to initiate an entirely new kind of zoning ordinance for the City's multi family housing areas: with the hope that this new ordinance will permit high intensity development of Pasadena to continue in a way which is thoroughly in keeping with the city's historic heritage. Above all, the Board directed us to find a way which would bring future development of the city into harmony with the beautiful character of the city, with a guarantee that future development, no matter how intensive, will preserve and protect and extend that beauty for which the city is so famous.</p>
  <p>This document is our first draft of an attempt to meet the City Board's request. It contains, we believe, the germ of an entirely new attempt to bring a beautiful city to order, in ways which have not been attempted in the last few decades.</p>
  <p>In the late twentieth century many cities in America suffer from a deep seated malaise. The city desires and supports development for economic and social reasons, but the beauty and fabric once loved by their inhabitants is then overwhelmed by widespread high intensity development. One day the inhabitants wake up and ask themselves "Where is our city? Where has it gone?"</p>
  <p>No one is directly to blame for the occurrence of this problem. Builders and developers are doing their best, within the fabric of rules which exist, to make decent buildings, and to maintain and improve the city's larger fabric. But within the zoning ordinances that presently exist their task is impossible. The systems of regulations in present-day ordinances are narrow, binding, and short sighted. Unintentionally, they create a set of conditions which simply do not allow developers and builders to make the kind of city which they would like to make.</p>
  <p>It is unfortunately common to blame the developers for the troubles which occur. Yet what is at fault, ultimately, is not the developers but the rules themselves. A conventional zoning ordinance is intrinsically not able to provide the framework in which people can make a beautiful city for themselves. As a result, because the zoning rules <em>themselves</em> create impossible conditions, the flurry of high intensity development creates the ugliness and crudity which many people deplore.</p>
  <p>In this ordinance, we have been commissioned, by the city board of Pasadena, to construct an entirely new form of document which goes deep enough to the structure of the underlying rules and processes themselves, so that it is capable of giving all the citizens of Pasadena -- developers, citizen groups, local government bodies, and private citizens, the opportunity to contribute to the formation of the great beauty which Pasadena was once famous for.</p>

  INTENT OF THE ORDINANCE
  <h2 class="lines">1.1<br>
  INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p>The mandatory standards prescribed by this ordinance are defined in chapter 3. In addition, the ordinance contains other material which creates the context in which the standards are to be understood. Chapter 1 describes intent. Chapter 2 describes the use of the ordinance. Chapter 4 shows by example, what the ordinance is intended to do. These three chapters are as much part of the ordinance as chapter 3 which specifies the standards. They express the intent of the ordinance and give the necessary background within which the specific standards of the ordinance may be interpreted.</p>
  <p>Thus the most fundamental way in which this ordinance differs from many existing ordinances is that it relies on understanding <em>and</em> regulation, not regulation alone. All existing ordinances contain standards. But these standards are rarely presented with any clear explanation of the overall vision which they embody. Many zoning ordinances and many individual standards, regrettably, do not embody any overall vision at all.</p>
  <p>The organisation of this ordinance is different because it explicitly contains the vision behind the ordinance, as part and parcel of the document. The core of standards which are presented in chapter 3, are specifically intended to create a city according to a certain vision. This vision is explicit and it is intended that the people who follow the ordinance, in preparing projects for development or construction, will specifically understand the overall vision and intent of the city, and will do their best to adhere to it.</p>
  <p>Thus the specific standards of the ordinance are to be understood as instruments, within the larger purpose of this vision. The way the ordinance is organised requires that all those who use and administer the standards, must also grasp this larger purpose, and explicitly do their best to contribute to it. Above all, from a legal standpoint, it is this more widely drawn purpose which will provide the legal context for interpretations of the standards.</p>
  <p>The four chapters of the ordinance thus together define the legal framework of the ordinance.</p></a> <a name="1_2" id="1_2">
  <h2 class="lines">1.2<br>
  OBSERVATIONS: THE CHARACTER OF PASADENA</h2>
  <p>As a background to the ordinance, we begin with a series of observations which define those qualities in the city which are vital to its character and quality.</p>
  <p>The character of Pasadena is something which people feel, and wish to preserve. Yet it is hard to define in simple quantifiable terms. Also, it cannot be attributed clearly, to any one part of town. The city is varied. It is the sum total of these variations and qualities which make up the unique and precious character that people love and are attached to.</p>
  <p>According to our observations, the special character of the city comes from a series of qualities, which may be understood according to the following categories.</p>
  <p>1. The character of streets.<br>
  2. The quality of open space.<br>
  3. The size of open space.<br>
  4. Existence of certain key building types.<br>
  5. Building height.<br>
  6. Building shape.<br>
  7. Building density.<br>
  8. Quality of parking.<br>
  9. Quality of driveways.<br>
  10. Identity of individual units.<br>
  11. Building materials and color.<br>
  12. Roofs and building details.<br>
  13. Trees, plants and gardens.<br>
  14. Paving and ground surface.</p>
  <p>In each of these fourteen categories, we shall now outline what we believe to be the essential characteristics that "make" the character of the city.</p>
  <p>1. <em>The character of streets.</em> Important qualities of Pasadena streets: No parking allowed at night, which creates a general absence of cars compared with other cities, and s more slow and graceful character, dominated more by trees and buildings. The canopy of beautiful trees, and avenue-like character of many streets. Green patch of grass between building and sidewalk. A definite long space formed between the line of trees and building fronts. Buildings entering into the street, so that street is enlivened by the buildings, doors and windows, stoops, and entrances.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>2. <em>The quality of open space.</em> The most noticeable and important quality of Pasadena neighborhoods is their overall garden character. In the most memorable places, a character dominated by gardens. In a few all-important historical cases, these gardens exist in the form of internal or half enclosed courtyards. In all cases, these courtyards and gardens are rather generous. Magnificent front lawns, or glimpses of hidden gardens or courtyards. In all cases, this beautiful private space (whether in the form of gardens, or courtyards) is visible, and felt, for a person on the street.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>3. <em>The size of open apace.</em> A crucial factor in the special feeling of the open space and gardens and courtyards in Pasadena is the physical size of the spaces. Interior courtyards of the old Pasadena type, are typically 50x80, 45x85, 45x75 etc, with an average size of 3500 to 4000 sf. Front gardens which achieve a feeling of pleasantness ,in relation to the buildings they support, tend to be in the range of 35x75, 40x70, etc, almost never less than 3000 sf. In many cases, small gardens are amplified in their feeling by adjacent gardens. In these cases, the various gardens which work together, even when they appear quite modest, are often 4000, 5000 and up. For instance, four front gardens at Locust and Holliston, are 40x45 each, and together form a valuable part of the street, which has an area of 6-7000 sf. In other cases, small interior gardens are amplified in their feeling, by adjacent setbacks, side yards, other other interior gardens and yards.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>4. <em>Existence of certain key building types.</em> The major building types which created the character of Pasadena originally, were all highly respectful of space. The courtyard type, which creates an interior garden, that creates movement in and out, and creates a threshold to the interior of the building. The bungalow type, which creates s small compact volume, with a definite shaped garden next to it. The old apartment type, which creates a single block of apartments, and once again, has one or two gardens, with definite shapes, sometimes trapped between the building and its garages. The mansion type, with a large and beautiful front lawn, going down to the street, this lawn shaped by buildings on either side.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>5. <em>Building height.</em> Most of the old and beautiful character of Pasadena is two-story construction. Careful observation of existing streets like Oakland, So E1 Molino, California, San Pasqual, etc, shows that the special feeling of the street and neighborhood character comes from the one-story and two-story buildings. More particularly, we have identified the following characteristics. In the places with a beautiful feeling, houses and apartments are almost always two-story. In many places a mixture of one-story buildings, even in modest amount, helps to keep the character. Three-story buildings most often do something to destroy the feeling. Occasional three-story buildings in back are not harmful. Threestory buildings scattered here and there are alright too, as long as they do not play a dominant role. It is the two-story scale, with its particular feeling of relationship between window and ground, between a human person and the roofline, that establishes the comfortable and domestic quality of the "old" Pasadena.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>6. <em>Building shape.</em> In addition, the actual shape and form of buildings is very important. Some of the older types, have a simple and harmonious character. For example: Buildings with a squarish volume, are common and pleasant. Buildings which are long and narrow, but <em>parallel</em> to the street. Small bungalows, with strongly pitched roofs. On larger buildings, flat roofs with strong cornice details. Buildings with apartments over garages are part of old and pleasant character. Pitched roof buildings, over long narrow buildings, helping to form courtyards where the save forms the space. By comparison, several newer types utterly destroy neighborhood character. Long buildings at right angles to the street, especially when they have blind fronts, are among the most disrespectful.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>7. <em>Building density.</em> The density and texture of the old city, is a principal factor in the beauty which people remember. Buildings and the gardens are in equal balance. It is not a dense conglomeration in which buildings exceed gardens. It is not a suburban texture in which gardens outweigh buildings. Also, within this texture, buildings are of reasonable scale. The massive development projects covering many lots, are totally at odds with this texture. Density is such that most buildings have a direct relation to the ground. It is the equal relationship of building to garden where you feel the ground, you feel the garden, and you feel the building, that is most important. The city has a close grain, of relatively small projects, on lots large enough to contain beautiful gardens, but not large enough to permit "mass development".</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>8. <em>Quality of parking.</em> The Pasadena quality depends very much on a specific characteristic: Parking is invisible. This is usually because it is behind the buildings. The long lots make this particularly natural and sensible in Pasadena. Parking ratio, especially in those parts of Pasadena which people love the most, was extremely low -sometimes as low as 0.5, and 1.0 at the most. In beautiful areas, parked care are <em>never</em> visible. Present day "six-pack" and tuck-under arrangements, where parked cars and driveways dominate the scene, are highly destructive. Underground parking is consistent with the city's character only when it avoids the platform solution, and leaves gardens which are on earth, not over concrete. Podium projects, create an air of artificiality which destroys the old feeling. This is occasionally avoided, when the podium is very carefully graded in, with softly sloping gardens coming from podium height to street. In the old city, many parking lots are pleasant to be in, almost like minor backyards or patios.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>9. <em>Quality of driveways.</em> Driveways, like parking, play an important role in the feeling of Pasadena. Driveways in older projects are very modest in width. In addition, the driveways which were built, in the old days, were not only narrow, but also beautifully useful and pleasant, even as places to walk. There were also few curb cuts, and those which exist are small and unobtrusive. Driveways that are beautiful in Pasadena are like mysterious paths, leading through trees or shrubs, to some place in the back. Recent projects like six-pack developments, where a wide aisle and parked care entirely dominate half of a 50 foot lot with asphalt and care, completely lose this character.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>10. <em>Identity of individual units.</em> In the Pasadena which people remember and love, each part of the apace has a human character. This comes partly from the care of craftsmanship; but it comes above all, because places have identity of ownership of individuals and individual families. In recent times, the apartments and condominiums have begun to create an abstract character, caused essentially by the development process. Yet, even in condominiums and apartment buildings, when made old style, one had a comfortable and individual human touch, in each one of these places. In detail, we can pick out the following characteristics. Each persons front door clearly marked. Use of outdoor stairs, leading to one or two units. Plentiful flowers, seats, benches, tables, belonging to individual families. Private outdoor space, earmarked by individual families. Group space, in gardens and courtyards, which is shared by a small number of families, not managed by abstract developer. Spots in the sun, where people can sit outside. Individual colors, paint, etc, on windows and doors, marking individual units.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>11. <em>Building materials and color.</em> The actual materials of the "typical" Pasadena are quite different from many of the recently built low-quality developments. Stucco and plaster exterior work is dominant. This does not only include the Spanish colonial style, but also a more american stucco, often brown or grey, less pretentiously spanish, but still very much the essence of Pasadena. Tile roofs, flat roofs, slate roofs. Red paving tile on the ground, was often important. Low masonry walls, plastered block. Wooden windows. Flower beds and flowering bushes. Craftsman bungalow construction with redwood, visible beams, small details. All done in a rather informal style, elegant and simple, but not pretentious.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>12. <em>Roofs and building details.</em> Some recently imported building materials and details are very destructive to the Pasadena character. Cedar aiding, for example, and washed stained wood surfaces are not consistent with the feeling of the town. Cheap stucco is also unsuitable: it should be broomed or trowelled. Aluminium window details should be avoided when possible, or modified. In general window details are crucial: much of the old Pasadena character came from windows and window-sills. Door-surrounds play an important role. Doors to apartments, and doors of passage ways, are marked with a moulding, at the change of surface. Some brick details. The essence of the good details, is not the expense of the details, but the love and care with which they are placed. In the craft tradition, which existed in Pasadena, the individual bits of buildings, were made by people who cared about what they were doing. That is the most easily destroyed by development, that is essentially abstract in character. Concrete block is fine.</p>
  <p>13. <em>Trees, plants and gardens.</em> One characteristic of recent developments in Pasadena, is an extremely unintelligent approach to planting. This happens when plants are placed indiscriminately, merely to satisfy a landscaping requirement, and completely fail to create pleasant masses of vegetation, which has any human significance. Typical examples: birch saplings planted along with planter boxes and pebble precast paving. 1n the Pasadena which people love, the vegetation has a more definite and formal character. Flower beds along buildings. Lawns of definite shape. Trees in groups, forming edges of space. Flowering bushes, in definite masses, which help to enliven a particular garden or courtyard or terrace. Hanging gardens, potted flowers, etc, which again form clear edges to spaces like terraces of definite geometry and shape. Single trees, in courtyards, giving shade and making a center to the space. Hedges, forming edges of lawns or gardens. Small walls, which people can sit on, or walls with doors and windows.</p>
  <p class="center">PHOTOGRAPHS</p>
  <p>14. <em>Paving and ground surface.</em> The ground surface of the loved Pasadena also has very definite characteristics. Once again, it is not fancy, but elegant and simple. Inexpensive concrete on paths and driveways. Asphalt for people to walk on. Mexican paving tile laid in the earth with grout but not necessarily laid on a slab (this latter is too expensive, and tends to create a false expensive image). What matters in not the price, but the care with which the thing is made.</p>

  TWO FUNDAMENTAL PROBLEMS WHICH MUST BE SOLVED</h2>
  <p>If we examine the picture of historic and beloved Pasadena, and compare it with contemporary reality and with the buildings that have been built in recent years, it is clear that there is a very great discrepancy between the two. On the face of it, it would seem that it just is not possible, today, to build buildings which are consistent with the great tradition of Pasadena.</p>
  <p>Yet the City Board has made it clear that it is precisely this which they have ordered: an ordinance which does indeed make it possible to preserve and extend the city of Pasadena in a manner consistent with the great tradition of the city and in a manner which preserves and protects its neighborhoods, at densities which are consistent with contemporary economic development.</p>
  <p>In order to achieve a rebirth of the neighborhoods, and yet maintain the development densities implicit in current practice, two fundamental problems must be solved. (1) The statistics of land coverage must be changed. (2) Individual projects are disrespectful of the neighborhood in which they occur. In the following pages, we define these two problems at greater length.</p>
  <p>(1) <em>The statistics of land coverage.</em></p>
  <p>Under present zoning requirements, land coverage is <em>forced</em> to have a distribution of uses which is inconsistent with Pasadena traditions. Here is the distribution of land coverage in projects developed at RM-32 and RM-48 under existing regulations.</p>
  <table width="50%">
    <tr>
      <td>Back and side setbacks</td>
      <td align="right">17-20%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Front setbacks</td>
      <td align="right">10%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Driveways</td>
      <td align="right">15%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Parking at grade</td>
      <td align="right">43%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Apartments at grade</td>
      <td align="right">12%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Usable gardens</td>
      <td align="right"><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;0-3%</u></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td align="right">100%</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>These statistics follow directly from the rules of the present zoning ordinance. Under the circumstances prescribed by these statistics, it is inevitable that open space is mainly concentrated in front setbacks, and therefore useless. It is inevitable that there are no useful interior gardens in the projects. It is inevitable that the overwhelming impression of parking will be crested. It is inevitable that parking will be at least partially aggregated in the front of lots, and therefore visible from the street. It is inevitable that narrow lot development will present a grim and unfriendly face to the street. It is also inevitable that buildings are frequently built at three storeys along the street, in such a way as to ravage the street character of the city. And it is inevitable, finally, that developers can in many cases, not reach the theoretical densities prescribed in the present zoning ordinance, because it is just too hard to do, especially on narrow lots.</p>
  <p>Perhaps the single most important factor in the destruction of the character of Pasadena is the <em>very high parking ratio</em> and the excessive amount of land devoted to asphalt. When parking is at grade 43% of the land is given to parking This leads to an almost complete loss of open space, and destruction of the garden character of Pasadena. The place of gardens and courtyards in the older apartment buildings of Pasadena have been replaced by the parking and parking aisles in the newer projects.</p>
  <p>The destructive character of parking cannot be altered without changing the currently accepted 2:1 parking ratio. The 2:1 ratio is possible in cities with a lower density: it is not possible in a city with the high densities proposed for Pasadena, without destructive effects. If we wish to maintain high densities, the parking ratio must be reduced. Our studies suggest that 1:1.5 would be an appropriate ratio. This will reduce parking from 43% to 33%.</p>
  <p>Driveways also take up an extraordinary amount of the total land. This is aggravated by the narrow lots now typical in Pasadena. If there is a driveway on every 50' lot, and this driveway is built to the current 12' standard, the driveways alone will then consume 20% of all available private land in the city. It is therefore absolutely necessary to reduce the total number of driveways by a gradual introduction of a form of driveway-sharing, to codify the driveway width end curb cut width, end to prohibit all double width driveways. If done correctly, this can reduce land devoted to driveways from 15:C to 10%.</p>
  <p>Next most damaging are setbacks. The statistics on the previous page show that an immense percentage of open space is used to meet present side and backyard setback requirements: 20% of the lot area. This space is wasted in unusable strips of land. In spite of the huge percentage devoted to this use, no-one appreciates or even notices the presence of these spaces. To avoid the waste back and sideyards must be reduced and some zero lot line construction must be permitted when appropriate. We estimate this can reduce land spent on setbacks from 2016 to 10%.</p>
  <p>Front setbacks are also wasteful. Although appropriate in some places where they contribute to street quality, in other places these setbacks represent empty formalities which no longer produce the benefits expected. By careful reduction of front setbacks, when appropriate, it is possible to reduce the land spent from 10% to 7%.</p>
  <p>We now come to gardens and courtyards. The single most important feature in the layout of Pasadena is its generous gardens, lawns, and courtyards. At the same time, the most noticeable feature of bad current development, is that it rarely takes responsibility for making beautiful and useful space <em>at all</em>. As we see from the land coverage statistics, this comes about because the combination of parking, driveways, and setbacks simply make it impossible to do anything else. Thus present conditions make it all but impossible to make beautiful or generous courtyard and garden space. The set-backs force building volumes to the centers of lots, and leave the front, side end back yards as leftovers which are unpleasant and contribute nothing to the city or the neighborhood.</p>
  <p>Yet it is our belief that open space -- its size sad character -- is the single most important thing defining the quality of the environment in Pasadena. In order to create a harmonious atmosphere in the city, and in order to preserve the character of the neighborhoods, and enhance their life and pleasantness, it is necessary to provide adequate outdoor space -- and this outdoor space must be organised to form real gardens large enough to have meaning and value.</p>
  <p>Careful examination of the real character of Pasadena streets and lots, shows that the gardens and courtyards which have the host beneficial effect on the environment, are in almost ell cases much larger than we imagine. For example, the courtyard of the building on California west of South E1 Molino, has a courtyard which is about 80'x45', almost 3500 sf. The front garden of the grey apartment building at the northwest corner of South E1 Molino and California is about 45x60 -- 2700 sf. In traditional terms, this is rather a modest garden. It is almost at the low end of something whose space is adequate for emotional "breathing space". By contrast, the typical RM48 development at Holliston dust north of Colorado, has a courtyard apace perhaps 20x30, end surrounded on 70% of its perimeter with two story buildings. It is a meaningless small space, which feels deserted, and unpleasant. It has no emotional reward.</p>
  <p>Even in cases where the scale of some outdoor space seems to be tiny and charming, when it is adequate emotionally, it is almost invariably bigger than we think. For example, the curving lane south of California, with small houses along it, is a case where the open space or garden happens to be street-like in character. At first sight, one would say that it is small, and supports the argument that outdoor apace does not have to be large in order to be satisfying. But the actual dimensions are surprising. There are so many ins and outs, and so many secondary spaces which encroach from the sides and form the space, that the overall width varies from 25 to 60', and the length of the perceived space is on the order of 100'. Once again, even taking an average width, the effective size of the thing is on the order of about 3500 - 4500 sf.</p>
  <p>Sometimes the essential size of the outdoor garden is hard to see, because it crosses from one lot to another. A good example is the beautiful set of four front lawns at Locust and Holliston. These lawns <em>together</em> make a beautiful space, which gives the life and character to these four houses. It is about 42' deep, and about 180 feet long -- a total size of almost 8000 of. It does not seem very big. It seems small in scale, intimate, but adequate.</p>
  <p>On the basis of these observations we have come to the conclusion that an adequate environment for Pasadena, can only be made of beautiful gardens which are adequate in size, meaningful in character. This will require that every project either provides a single coherent garden space of at least 3000 of, or at least that it contributes directly to the formation of such a space, in conjunction with some other project.</p>
  <p>Finally, we must make a similar observation about the apartments themselves. Under present conditions the great majority of apartments are not on the ground. In order to make sense of a pattern in which larger gardens are provided, it is necessary that the number of apartments at grade is strongly increased.</p>
  <p>We may summarise all these observations, by going back to the distribution of land coverage. To avoid the wasteful problems which exist, and to do justice to the environment of Pasadena, the statistics must be adjusted and land coverage redistributed until it reaches a distribution which looks something like this.</p>
  <table width="50%">
    <tr>
      <td>Usable gardens</td>
      <td align="right">28%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Apartments at grade</td>
      <td align="right">25%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Setbacks</td>
      <td align="right">5%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Driveways</td>
      <td align="right">10%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Parking at grade</td>
      <td align="right"><u>&nbsp;&nbsp;32%</u></td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>&nbsp;</td>
      <td align="right">100%</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
  <p>To make this possible, it is not only necessary to find a set of standards which will guarantee this redistribution. It is also necessary to identify an overall pattern of land, buildings and parking which makes it physically feasible.</p>
  <p>We now come to the second major problem that stands in the way of any process which can help to maintain the character of Pasadena neighborhoods.</p>
  <p>(2) <em>Individual protects ere disrespectful of the neighborhood in which they occur, and this disrespect is encouraged by the current ordinance.</em></p>
  <p>The problem here, is one of attitude. Present traditions encourage an attitude that deals only with the individual building project, without emphasizing its relationship to its immediate surroundings and the neighborhood as a whole.</p>
  <p>The most dramatic examples of this attitude are familiar. There are innumerable cases where a beautiful small building is swamped and destroyed environmentally, by large buildings, crudely placed, that overpower it, make its gardens unpleasant, overlook its windows, damage its scale. A three story building filling a lot, over undergound parking, and next a to a charming bungalow and its garden, is the image which most Pasadenans are familar with. This is the single effect which is perhaps most sensitive, and which most strongly makes people believe that high intensity development is damaging to neighborhoods.</p>
  <p>Other examples are common. Many buildings turn a blind eye to the street (end walls without windows or front doors) and ignore their responsibility to help the street. Individual developments show no respect for trees, for existing beautiful gardens, for the scale or quality of next door houses and older buildings. Buildings come close to the street destroying an established pattern of large front lawns, gardens and so on.</p>
  <p>The same thing occurs at an even more subtle level, in the matters of material, color, and overall harmony. If a Pasadena resident had to define, in a few words, what it is about the recent developments that is most disliked, it might simply be said: "Somehow, they dont fit in. Instead of respecting our beautiful city, and making ft better, each project ignores its surroundings, sticks out like a sore thumb, somehow makes things worse".</p>
  <p>All this is quite understandable. Under prevailing circumstances it is impossible for the neighborhoods to be preserved or enhanced by development because there is no mechanism whatever which helps it to happen. Indeed, present zoning law essentially forces it to happen, by imposing such severe constraints (of the wrong kind) on projects, that they cannot physically adapt themselves to the context of the neighborhood, and cannot make the contribution which their owners would often wish to do. As a result, under present circumstances, each new project tends to show a disrespect for its immediate surroundings and next-door projects.</p>
  <p>This problem cannot be solved by a superficial and totalitarian "Santa Barbara solution" in which ell buildings are made to conform to a uniform set of materials and building details. The problem lies much much deeper, fn the quality of space which forms the environment. The discomfort which Pasadena residents feel, in the presence of new and "unkind" apartment buildings, is not a superficial problem of style or color. It is a real problem caused by the fact that new buildings, as built under present planning law, do not have the opportunity to be helpful to the neighborhood in the apace which they create.</p>
  <p>The key insight required to solve this problem, lies in the the following fundamental fact: <em>The extent that any building is helpful, or not helpful to its neighborhood depends on the apace that it helps to create.</em> The wholesome character of the neighborhood is in the apace which is created there.</p>
  <p>In short, the fundamental way in which a building can be helpful to a neighborhood, is in the pattern of space which it creates. If it creates a pattern of space which is useful to the neighborhood, the building becomes harmonious and pleasant. For example, if the building helps to create usable garden to one side it is helpful, and the neighborhood becomes enlarged in feeling. If the building continues a beautiful lawn in front, by extending the space of a lawn on a next door building, a significant and beautiful thing happens in the neighborhood. If the building partially encloses parking, s parking lot takes on a positive character as a more contained place. If it helps to form a parking zone with connecting back driveways at the back of several lots, once again the neighborhood is helped. If the building makes a driveway which is a pleasant place to walk, instead of a no-mans land for cars, once again the neighborhood benefits. If the project is similar in scale to the buildings next to it, the community space of the neighborhood is strengthened and the people in the neighborhood will feel confirmed in their movements and habits. If the project preserves beautiful trees which are part of the heritage of the neighborhood again the neighborhood is helped.</p>
  <p>Thus all neighborhood space is created by the individual building projects. If the buildings fail to meet their obligations in helping to shape this apace, the neighborhood is irreparably damaged. When this happens, no amount of superficial sexing up the details of the buildings can make them work.</p>
  <p>It is clear that this second problem is tied directly to the first problem of land coverage statistics. Under present statistics, the developer does not have the opportunity to create space which is helpful to the neighborhood, because he is forced to squander the available space, on parking, driveways, and setbacks. The buildings which he produces are therefore necessarily unhelpful to the neighborhood, because the arithmetic does not provide him with any way of making a useful contribution to the neighborhood apace.</p>
  <p>This problem is made especially acute by the unusual size of available lots in modern Pasadena. One of the most significant facts in the development of Pasadena, is the fact that the majority of developments are made on single parcels. Estimates from city staff indicate that <em>80-90% of all projects are single lot developments.</em></p>
  <p>The spatial entities which are needed to make a neighborhood comfortable, are simply larger than anything you can do within a single lot. No developer on a single lot, can help the neighborhood if it is occupied only with the internal development of the lot. A single lot can make an adequate contribution to its neighborhood only when it turns its attention outward.</p>
  <p>In addition, the statistics described earlier are very much worse on single lots than on double lots. Driveways and setbacks consume an even greater relative percentage on single 1 ots.</p>
  <p>Thus at the densities prescribed by RM16, RM32 and RM48, the only way that single lot developments can work spatially, to the benefit of the neighborhood, is if they can find a way of pooling their spatial resources. Careful study of the environment which is desirable on a block, clearly shows that there is a need for more generous gardens, for fewer driveways, and for buildings that respect each other's presence. This translates into a need for a more beneficial and interlocked development, in which formations of parking, driveways, gardens, courtyards, and buildings, introduced by individual developers, extend from lot to lot, in the sense that they respect the apace of adjacent developments in a cooperative way and create larger configurations than those which exist today on single lots.</p>
  <p>This does not imply any loss of autonomy by individual owners. It is a well established principle of American property, that each property-owner is free to develop his own property, in the way that he sees fit. What is implied here, is that ancient American principles of community responsibility are re-incorporated into law, and form the background and context within a which a developer pursues his private ends.</p>
  <p>What is needed is a principle of connection between adjacent projects, which allows each project to take its place within a larger whole and to make a contribution to it, while <em>extending</em>, not hindering, the individuals private rights. In exchange for this community spirit on the part of the private property owner, the city, through this ordinance, must then give the private owner greater freedom in the range of densities and configurations than that which is now permitted.</p>
  <p>Without this change of attitude, new projects will continue to create a sense of disruption, and there is no way that modern development can be made to help the neighborhoods.</p></a> <a name="1_4" id="1_4">

  THE COHERENCE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD</h2>
  <p>Within present concepts of zoning, the fundamental problems defined in section 1.3 might seem to be unsolvable. They pose serious difficulties and it might be said that, at least within the framework of the current zoning, they cannot be solved without forcing unacceptable sacrifices on the users. However, as we shall now see, these problems can be solved, provided that we pay careful attention to their interaction: and provided that we work within a vision of the neighborhood as a whole. This is what we mean by the coherence of the neighborhood.</p>
  <p>The solution of the problems has two parts.</p>
  <p>First, a vision of the city, in which wasteful driveways, parking and setbacks are transformed into garden and courtyard space. This hinges on a reorganisation of space, which we shall explain, se an archetypal pattern, by means of diagrams. It includes the absolutely fundamental ides that buildings <em>help to shape open space</em>, and must be required to do so. It also hinges on an analysis which shows that prevailing desired densities in the three existing categories (RM16, RM32 and RM48) are all attainable within this pattern, without increasing building heights above two and three storeys.</p>
  <p>Second, a clear view of the problem of context sensitivity. The holistic pattern of space in a neighborhood can only work, if each project plays its role in helping to create the larger whole: and this, in turn, requires that <em>each project be context sensitive</em> to an unusual degree. Each project is able to help the creation of the whole, because it makes n variety of small scale internal adaptations within its own structure: and these result in a much more sensitive relation between the individual projects and existing trees, buildings and gardens.</p>
  <p>One may express both these ideas together, in a nutshell, by saying that they require that individual projects become more helpful, than they have been in the past. As we shall see, the result of this greater helpfulness, is to improve individual projects so that all private developments clearly benefit from the contribution they are required to make to the neighborhood, because the overall system of rules is more favorable to the creation of a good environment on private lots.</p>
  <p>All this means that the ultimate purpose of the ordinance is to establish the <em>neighborhood</em> as its basis and to protect and enhance its character. Within this conceptual framework, each individual project then has the "task" or obligation to do as much as it can to increase the well-being and "wholeness" of the neighborhood in which it is built.</p>
  <p>(1) <em>The pattern of the neighborhood.</em></p>
  <p>To solve the problem of land coverage statistics, we have constructed the pattern of an ideal block for a Pasadena multifamily housing neighborhood which has the "right" statistics. This pattern incorporates three structures: (1) Street and gardens (2) Parking and (3) Building forms.</p>
  <p>The pattern includes the most beautiful street we can imagine, from the point of view of outdoor space connected to it -courtyards and gardens. This street has large gardens, courtyards, deep setbacks where the setback has positive value as outdoor space, and shallow setbacks where it does not. There is a pattern of interconnection between these gardens which makes a continuous and beautiful fabric of open space. It is the overall effect and character of this street-plusgardens, which makes the neighborhood beautiful. The primary obligation of each individual project, is therefore to create beautiful and useful gardens. The buildings, seen from the point of view of the neighborhood, are the means through which gardens are created.</p>
  <p>The pattern includes parking which is coherent and beautiful too. In its own terms it has its own integrity as a structure of parking lots and driveways. In case it seems odd to say that parking might be beautiful, we want to emphasise that many of the older buildings in Pasadena do indeed have beautiful parking, where the driveway, and parking lot and garages, themselves form usable and pleasant space, humane in its own terms.</p>
  <p>Finally, the building volumes in this pattern also have their own definiteness of shape. They always enclose gardens and shape them as positive apace. Each building volume, as a structure, lays at the "head" of its garden, with most apartments opening directly into the garden or courtyard. There are small passageways through the buildings connecting parking with the inner garden. Buildings are placed in such s way so that gardens end driveways, though most often separate, could sometimes cross, or run side by side. Because of their relative narrowness, all the building volumes guarantee good daylight and sunlight in the buildings.</p>
  <p>These three components of the pattern and their interrelationships are shown in the following sequence of diagrams. It is important to notice that the pattern of space in each diagram has a coherent structure: and that the three structures are deeply interlocked to make each one positive.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="structure_of_gardens.gif" width="360" height="288" alt="structure of gardens"></p>
  <p class="center"><img src="structure_of_parking.gif" width="360" height="289" alt="structure of parking"></p>
  <p class="center"><img src="structure_of_buildings.gif" width="360" height="294" alt="structure of buildings"></p>
  <p>It is very important to note that this pattern is capable of reaching extremely high densities without increasing building heights and without damaging environmental character. Although it maintains a beautiful gardens and street character the pattern (as expressed in the standards of this ordinance) allows densities up to 30 units per acre to be built in the RM16 zone, it allows densities of up to 38 units per acre to be built in the RM32 zone, and it allows densities of up to 51 units per acre to be built in the RM48 zone.</p>
  <p>We believe that this pattern is the only one which is capable of solving the problems that are described in section 1.3. The problem is solved by reducing the waste of space which is typical of present pattern of development.</p>
  <p>1. We avoid wasting land on setbacks.<br>
  2. The number of driveways is reduced.<br>
  3. No land is wasted on small useless bits of open space, and all open pace is aggregated to form coherent and useful gardens.<br>
  4. There are always apartments over parking structures, so as to avoid wasting the air apace over parking garages.<br>
  5. Parking-to-unit ratio is 1.5 cars/unit, to reduce the total area given to parking.</p>
  <p>(2) Context sensitivity.</p>
  <p>We have already observed that the single most damaging aspect of current development in Pasadena, is the way in which individual projects fail to create harmony in the neighborhoods, and instead produce an incoherent and abrasive intrusion. This problem is linked to the gradual emergence of the pattern which we have just described.</p>
  <p>At present Pasadena has a unique mixture of different projects on different blocks, some old, some quite new, others of varying age and character. It will only be possible to build up the new space pattern described in the previous section, if each new project is able to adapt sensitively to the particular and unique configuration that exists around it.</p>
  <p>It would be quite impossible, and also highly undesirable, to impose the new pattern as some kind of grand plan on the existing neighborhoods. Instead, it is only possible to reach it by a very gradual process of accretion, in which new projects make some contribution towards this vision, and then gradually, over a period of ten to twenty years this pattern emerges, from n long series of piecemeal and private acts undertaken by individual developers.</p>
  <p>For this to succeed, it requires an extraordinary sensitivity on the part of each individual project, to the unique characteristics of the neighborhood around it, and even to the particular attributes of buildings which stand next door and two doors away. It is therefore necessary to set forth principles which make it clear <em>how</em> each project is expected to play its role in the gradual creation of this pattern.</p>
  <p>First, we shall encourage adjacent properties to connect with one another in a helpful fashion with a connected sequence of gardens, shared driveways, parking and building volumes working together, even though each project is done individually and takes place at its own time. The whole solution to the environmental problem lies in this connection and working together of adjacent properties.</p>
  <p>Within this framework each project must be shaped according to its context so that it makes a contribution to the overall neighborhood pattern -and also pays attention to the specifics of next-door buildings, trees, gardens, and all the other idiosyncrasies which make each neighborhood unique. The ordinance will provide the mechanisms to assure the development of projects which are sensitive to their individual contexts in this way.</p>
  <p>This "context-sensitive nature" of the neighborhood problem, requires that the ordinance has a process which avoids the trap of simple stereotypes in the projects that are built, and is capable of producing a rich variety of projects that are unique and beautiful, each one according to the particular harmony of the neighborhood where it occurs.</p>
  <p>The following three drawings show a sequence of imaginary projects, done by three independent developers, on three adjacent sites. These examples, which are consistent with the requirements of the ordinance, show how projects by independent developers, acting individually, have the ability to form connections to the existing fabric of the neighborhood and to one anothers projects, and thus create a larger organisation which is desirable for the neighborhood.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="lot_development.gif" width="360" height="747" alt="sequential development on three adjacent lots"></p>
  <p>The drawing on the next page shows a more elaborate simulation of the development of an existing Pasadena neighborhood over a ten year period. The example shows a neighborhood of thirty six individual lots. Twenty of them have new projects. The remaining sixteen have existing projects as they stand today. Each one of the new projects is assumed to have been developed at a different time, by a different developer working according to the process of this ordinance. The three projects shown on the previous page, are visible in the bottom right hand corner.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="neighborhood_development.gif" width="504" height="682" alt="piecemeal neighborhood development"></p>
  <p>This example shows how the ordinance will help to create coherent development in the neighborhood when separate and independent developers pursue their own aims on nearby parcels. Although the developers are acting individually and privately, the effect of the ordinance is to make sure that their separate projects <em>together</em> tend to produce a greater whole in their contributions to the neighborhood. Each new project emphasizes its relationship and connection with its adjacent projects, through connected gardens, shared driveways, and related buildings. Together these developments succeed in creating a neighborhood that is pleasant to live in. Above all, <em>each project is respectful to what existed in the neighborhood at the time that it was built.</em></p>
  <p>On the pages following we show photographs of a model which simulates development of thirty projects according to the provisions of the ordinance.</p>
