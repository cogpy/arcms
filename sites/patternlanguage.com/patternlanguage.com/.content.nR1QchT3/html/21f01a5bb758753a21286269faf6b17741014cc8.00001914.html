          </center><font color="brown">For the last year and a half Stuart Cowan and Katy Langstaff have been working on a pattern language which provides a complete ecological model for a coherent, sustainable, ecology. They are based in Ecotrust, 1200 NW Naito Parkway, Suite 470, Portland, OR 97209 Tel: 503 227 6225 Fax: 503 222 1517 The project is enormously ambitious, and it is, to my knowledge, the first time that such a comprehensive ecological picture has been attempted.</font>
          <p><font color="brown">It is important, obviously, for its content, which presents a vision of a complete natural/human habitat, constructed and maintained according to natural and ecological principles. Their work provides huge food for thought, and I encourage visitors to this website to go and look at it. Today, you can get there from this page. In future, you may also visit it by going from the Links page of this Bookshelf.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">The big question, of course, is How is this to be implemented. Stuart writes that he imagines a process-based system of processes and sequences, perhaps similar to those now being developed on this Web Site, as the practical underpinning to the visions presented in the ecological pattern language.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">That is the necessary and even more exciting part of the work. Until we have a practicable system of processes which may be invoked, to generate the large scale structures of the ecological system, it will not happen.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">I urge interested people to help them, and to help us at PatternLanguage.com, by thinking through the details of sequences and processes which may have the right structural results, and generate these necessary patterns in the large.</font></p>
