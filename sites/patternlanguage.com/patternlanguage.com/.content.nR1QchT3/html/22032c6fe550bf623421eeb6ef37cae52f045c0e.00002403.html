        <p>To create the structure of living space which makes a city, it is necessary that certain freedoms exist to make the right kind of space, with the right attributes, and the right connectivity, in the right places.</p>
        <p>However, several dominant features of present-day urban life, create opposing pressures, which interfere with the process of creating the living structure. These include the following (shown in red).</p>
        <p>Here, for illustration, are some possible solutions to these problems (shown blue). Have a look at these problems and needed solutions, and then, <a href="#vote"><b>DOWN BELOW</b></a>, vote your choices as to which of these needed solutions you would like to see implemented in Duncanville:</p>
