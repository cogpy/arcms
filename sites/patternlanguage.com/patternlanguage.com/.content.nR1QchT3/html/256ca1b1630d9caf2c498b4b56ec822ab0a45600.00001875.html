  <p><font size="4" color="#F3F5D9">The classic carpenter's workshop is the end product of years and years of gradual, painstaking adaptation. He is never trying very hard to make a "perfect" environment for himself. He is never under the illusion that he can reach anything perfect. He just keeps trying to make it a little bit better all the time.</font></p>
  <p><font size="4" color="#F3F5D9">The state of mind in which you can arrive at an office which works well for you is also low key and rather slow. This "easy" process requires a set of mental tools and steps to get you there. It is an adaptive process. But where the carpentry shop takes years to perfect, the adaptive process available here, tries to help you collapse the steps in time, so that you reach a similar goal, by thinking carefully about what the office does for you, and how it does it.</font></p>
