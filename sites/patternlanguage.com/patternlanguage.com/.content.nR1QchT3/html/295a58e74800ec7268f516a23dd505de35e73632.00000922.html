        <h3>One of our principal aims is to help architects make better buildings. We mean, by this, only to help each architect make more beautiful buildings, and to be able to marshall his own, and her own, creative talents, in a way which is more effective, produces a better building for the users, and creates a more profound and satisfying result.</h3>
        <h4>Examples of what we mean by life and by good buildings are illustrated in various places on this site. Have a look. <a href="../otherarchitects/otherarchitects.htm">There are pictures of work by architects around the world who have found ways of making life</a>. It seems to us that these works are similar in character, or method, or philosophy,to the buildings we have been trying to make ourselves. In other places we show examples of <a href="../projecttypes/projecttypes.htm">things we have built during the last thirty years</a>. We plan a new section showing <a href="../messages/inpreparation.htm">work done by architects and builders using the pattern language and other tools we have made available.</a></h4>
        <p>We plan another new section showing <a href="../messages/inpreparation.htm">work done by users</a> themselves using, by themselves, the pattern language and other tools we have made available.</p>
        <p>We will definitely begin a section showing works by members of the builders network, so that the overall work of our network becomes visible. And we may start a section called &quot;work in progress&quot; describing projects we are currently working on.</p>
