                <blockquote>
                  <font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">In the practices we have used for thirty years of design and construction, a special approach to cost has always played an essential role. You will often hear that good things cannot be made without spending more money. That simply is not true.</font></font>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">The essence of good design, and good building, is to work, from the beginning to the end of a project, with a tight and careful attitude toward cost control, always thinking about money, and the best use of the available budget, as a major feature of what is done. This must occupy us from the first day to the last.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">To create a living architecture does not require the use of more money than usual. It requires that the use of money is different, and that thought is given, from the first day, as to where to put the available money, and how to divide up the budget that you have, and how to keep the actual construction work so that it sticks to that budget.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">Although it is not easy to introduce these methods via a web site, we shall do our best to pass on to you the techniques we have developed, so that you and the people who work for you, can apply these methods to the projects which are done <i>by</i> you, and <i>for</i> you, using the techniques available on this site.</font></font></p>
