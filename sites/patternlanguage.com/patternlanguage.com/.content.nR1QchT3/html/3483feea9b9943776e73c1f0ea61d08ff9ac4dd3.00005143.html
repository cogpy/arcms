              <p>The extent of it, its height, the levelness of its surface should all be established. If you need equipment to accomplish it (a bobcat or small backhoe) borrow it from the city, or ask Public works to come and help you do it.</p>
              <p>It may be necessary to build a retaining wall, with steps, to make a level surface where you want it. You must then plan to build a retaining wall. It can be made with dry stacked blocks, using dry bagged concrete in the cells, and then puddled. Or you can form it and cast it in concrete.</p>
