They are young, old; they live in wealth and in poverty; some are architects and builders and planners connected with the task of building; others, more of our members, are simply people who are concerned because they are sickened by the direction 20th century construction took, and now, in this new millennium, they want to help create a living world around them.</h5>
          <p>The members help each other; we help them. The members are united by the possibility that we now have tools available, which are capable of creating a humane environment, and a living world in cities. They have joined our association because one of these tools is the pattern language; other more powerful tools are available on this website.</p>
