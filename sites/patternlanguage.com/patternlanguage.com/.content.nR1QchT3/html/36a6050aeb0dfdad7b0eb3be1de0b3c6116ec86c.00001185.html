                There is a photo of a Russian wooden church, an ascending series of onion dome shapes in the roof. Legend has it that the architect-builder, Nestor, did it with just an axe.</font>

Like when I intalled the most outrageous gate-railing combination I have yet managed to pull off, which is at 42 Winfield in San Francisco, (in case you are in the neighborhood) a passer-by got down on her knees in front of me and salomed! Of course she was kidding, but still, that's pretty strong from a complete stranger. If an artisan does their job, installation should initiate a period of "shock and awe." Especially considering that we are working in an environment that has become a wasteland due to degeneration of craft in building--it's pretty easy to blow their minds by putting more aesthetic effort into things.</font></p>

The police car shows the human recognition that it works. Way beyond this colors have a wide and subtle range of meaning in nature and culture, how did that evolve?<br>
                Color perception and implication is so internalized it becomes difficult to explain and impossible to look at with detachment, and the same goes for form.<br>
                This is one of Alexander's major obstacles, I think, in writing a "constitution" for beauty.<br>
                The sharp, spare, 90 degree top corner of the sunshade jars and disturbs, up close,alone, but from a distance with the whole house in the picture, a nicely rounded corner would jump out as incongrous extra care.<br>
                The perceptions and interpretations change depending on proximity and context. This consideration is in addition the matters of time, taste, style, refinement, ego involement, and quality you guys have already loaded on this poor little framework previously.<br>
                Maybe the interest has endured here because we can all be a bit superior and condescending about the whole matter so we comment from positions of strength.<br>
                I know that always gives me enough rope to hang myself.<br>

                One interesting aspect of this example is it is black and white detail on a structure that I presume is not black and white. I happened to have to clear two rattlesnakes from the yard right around that time and one thing about them in this area is they have, in a short section for a few inches just before the rattles, a beautiful section of black and white alternating bands which contrasts nicely with their grey or brown camoflage body pattern. The mosquitos around here also have b+w banding on their legs, I think. B+W is a snappy attention grabbing detail, a highlight that can look pretty cool as a surprise. So a little B+W detail, maybe a little incongruous, but maybe not. Maybe rolling with the same pattern that is rolling thru the rattlesnakes and mosquitoes.<br>
                There is a lizard around here called the Blue-tailed Skink which has a brown body with yellow stripes running towards the tail, which suddenly becomes a very beautiful, spectacular blue. In seems like such an odd combination of colors, yet the lizard is very beautiful. It is an interesting lesson to me as to "what 'Nature' can 'get away with' in terms of combining colors I would not expect could successfully go together well. Little do I know, of course! I wondered if this color move was prompted by a Strange Attractor, to use a word I heard of in Chaos Theory.</font>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi Everyone<br>
                Rob, that is an interesting one to ponder, about Dirk's job.<br>
                From his description, I got that the "success" of the job had to do with several factors. I say "success" because I don't think that I would like it, to see it, and would probably not hesitate to change/demo it based on my antipathy for that kind of stark, angular, 90-degree grid-ridden look, in black and white. How it related to the other centers of the house we don't know, but I got the sense that it didn't, very much. It was "structure-preserving" in some sense that was more to do with affection, memory, nostalgia for her father, maybe. And it seemed like there was a strong component of it doing something for her personality structure--she got a thrill of seeing what she wanted materialized at her command, felt "empowered," etc. Henry Shaeffer-Simmern used to say that form forms--that the "maker" gets transformed in the process of creating form. But, her end result was probably pleasing more to herself than anyone else. I doubt it was objectively beautiful in a sensual way. The pleasures of her "hard-edged" kind of an aesthetic seem more mentally based, abstracted away from emotional and tactile dimensions. I thought that was fascinating what Scarpa said, in my quote a while back, about the pure, undecorated cylindrical shape of the microphone being unsatisfactory because it was "UN-finite." The "bad modernists" don't seem to find that a problem, I think their root attitude really springs from a rejection of the body and its inevitable death and a consequent effort to flee to the consolations of immunized mind, where there is the safety of predictability. Dwell Magazine boosts the Modern thing as their main schtick, and they had a chat website and I got on there and "innocently" asked, "What is the difference between "good Modernism" and I gave the example of Gaudi's Modernismo and Bertoia's chair designs for Knoll Company, and "bad Modernism" which I said was the cliche stuff one sees everywhere that is formally banal--for example the endless sofa designs that all use the same stupid-looking steel tube legs. I had just read NOO vol one and I was annoyed that there was no mention of same in their magazine. I provoked a bit of a stir in there, which was fun.<br>
                But anyway, the difference between what she did and what the makers of the Ise Shrine did seems pretty great, in that she is clearly a beginner in the game, and something like the Ise Shrine was produced out of a tradition that has lapped her current position on the track thousands of times.<br>
                I found CA's case that one can objectively evaluate the beauty of a design by noticing how the centers are handled wonderful as a potential weapon to counterattack the proliferation of "bad" Modern design.</font>

But it's largely a software issue too; it's heretic to say, but Photoshop is in many respects a mallet when you need a tack hammer. I've never liked its drawing tools much, though it's much improved with a tablet. The new ones have an 'eraser' on the opposite end like a pencil, which is great. But there was a different piece of software when graphics first came out on the desktop, called Deluxe Paint, and it was marvelously intuitive. A German company made a knockoff a few years ago, I've forgotten where to find it.</font>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">At the moment I'm toying with the idea of "how do you introduce" the notions of centers, sequences, patterns and then apply them as a process, particularly for remodelling work.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I'm developing a form of contract for myself (partly inspired by the idea of generative building contracts), which is a number of things: contract for services, sequence of steps (as a timeline for the project), cost estimation of project, including cost of my work, skeleton of a 'pattern language' for the project etc... so right from the beggining clients have one document which serves as:<br>
                Fee proposal for my services<br>
                Generatvie sequence (showing process of design and sequence of steps showing the planning process generally)<br>
                Running alongside this are the attached costs with each stage and step.<br>
                In this scenario, even if clients don't proceed for some reason, they have a useful document showing them a number of things ie:<br>
                costs<br>
                design<br>
                building<br>
                A rough pattern language for the project</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">This way, I also get paid for everything I do, including quoting and doing the initial talking with clients.<br>
                First contact is telephone and then I email them some info. Once they call back its $550 to do first consultation.<br>
                It's something I have been wanting feedback on and thanks to Robs work, I'll probably be able to post it there for feedback.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Brians comment on 'reading centers' a while back seemed like an apt clue for me for remodelling work... so I'm trying to include in the above process a number of slightly different approaches in which the 'design' gets tested for its validity. I'm trying to do this by the following:<br>
                Statement of the clients needs as a brief, and a starting pattern language from this<br>
                Detailed description of the site, pattern language from this<br>
                Mapping and reading the centers, pattern language for this (including the latent and living centers)<br>
                then I ask what is ideal, or would make the most beatiful place for them, pattern language for this<br>
                I can almost overlay the 'pattern languages' in my head, and the client can test it themselves.<br>
                With this process, I'm also trying to iron the problem of exorbitant and unnecessary costs of plan modifications for councils and building inspectors... really by keeping the plans very 'generic', give them only whats needed, (the PL and not superflous details about the color of door knobs and toilet roll holers)... if additional technical detail is required this is usually done on site with the inspectors.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I guess I also ask the question as I think it can inform the construction of websites like Rob is doing now. If websites can infact roughly reflect the process of design and building it would be helpful to ordinary people, which not only introduces them to the ideas and approach of CA but gives some instruction how to get things built... taking into account many building, planning and design matters.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">About PL.com, if they come to the party, yeah, anything they do with this site is good, otherwise this still 'reflecting' pond might become a stagnant puddle.<br>
                I'm wondering also, if they will even provide an active link to Robs site... if not willing to improve it themselves.</font></p>

                You are a powerhouse on the site here, and with Vasco's incisive questions, and Rob working on the interactive tools, this venue has really come up recently, to the point where I'm wondering if with some editing by CES, or ourselves, we may have some publishable chapters here now, and in the future, as we dig deeper into the investigation... it's a thought.</font>

                People have to make livings, diversity is wonderful, you've got to see off occasionally, to recognise on. If it looks to you a little like a "bad" pattern, but you've witnessed the healing properties firsthand, what the hell, it's a good thing, case closed.<br>

                First casual response to inquiry,trying to establish and ascetain from both sides whether styles and standards will mesh nicely in the context of goal descriptions and initial attempts at description of work to be done style, standards and level of finish etc. I would characterize this phase as, safe, polite, respectful, mutual pshycoanalysis and world view appraisal.<br>
                Sometimes things end here in an easy understanding way, from one side or the other or both.<br>
                If some level of trust, confidence, comfort, and "sympatico" is established here the next level usually consists of me refering previous work in the form invitation to view, if thats ok or there is previous familiarity, I make a call to estimate the job and do a consultation. I do not charge for this and the is still no pressure on either side to committ untill we wrap up this phase. At that time I give an open quote, either time and material or bid, ballpark figures which I try to make high enough to allow for the inevitable surprises or upgrades.<br>
                I have only produced rough sketches generalized material quotes and an hour or two of consultation so far. I'm in it a hundred or two, I guess, but have never charged for this if the job goes South at this point, and you do still lose 'em at this point...<br>
                Beyond this point however, I do notify the client that detailed drawings and a real material list is the begining of a committment on their side to initiate compensation.<br>
                If that's fine then we get to deeper levels of material and design options, and try to craft the actual working concepts and papers for the job.<br>
                I'll line up behind Brian on the 3/3 formula, as the job always does speak back, usually from the get-go.</font>

                So..There IS accounting for taste?<br>
                The contrast thing is a bright light behind a narrow crack, I'll agree.<br>
                The enemy of true art, yes that sure fits. It's really what art is up against a lot of the time , huh..?<br>
                I just couldn't believe how that little structure broke so many of my personal rules but made her so happy.<br>
                I had to acknowledge that the best thing I had done was keep my mouth mostly shut and follow her directions, and execute to the best of my ability. You know: "The Hatchet Man".<br>
                Have I recently learned that sometimes this an evolutionary step up from using my experience to sell my own interpretations of the timeless, gracefull, pleasing, forms we as artists and artisans have produced for centuries. That is, if the client ends up genuinely satisfied and happy?<br>
                This is unsettling, but it's truth is in my face.<br>

                Delightful story from the front, Dirk.<br>
                The issue of taste is fascinating.<br>
                Wasn't it Picassco who said something like "Good taste is the enemy of Art?" Maybe not, don't remember...anyway...<br>
                Some years ago I was selling plants door-to-door in office buildings..yes, I know, NO SOLICITING. It so happened that, at the wholesaler where I got the plants, there were five different designs of little baskets with plastic liners that would hold a 6" or a 10" plastic pot so it did not leak on the floor. So one of these designs I hated, it had a star on it,woven in a different tone of brown bark. So I always picked through and avoided this design. One day they did not have enough of the others so I had to take a star type. Later, out in the field, I had a customer, a Chinese lady. It was often hard to sell to Chinese people, they were very canny and frugal and picky, so I usually did not expect to succeed with them. But this time, she picked a plant, and I showed her the four basket designs that I preferred. She didn't like any of them, and it looked like there would be no deal. Then I remembered that I had the "ugly duckling" star design basket, and I fished it out and showed it to her, She loved it and we had a deal. After that, I started keeping star baskets as part of my offerings, because I realized that for some people, it was a good design.<br>
                The satisfaction of your client with the job is great, it's fun. It is cool that you were able to give her the chance to manifest her desire in 4D. (I used to say 3D but after Rob turned me on to that site with the chaos theory links I have become converted.) The emotional "echo-factor" to what her father did was a nice thing to note as one of the factors in what is going on in her feeling core. If they genuinely love it, then there's something fine and true about the incident that seems more important than mere "taste." "Love conquers all."<br>
                There's a video called "Thelonius Monk--Straight, No Chaser" in which you can see Monk at a recording session where "for history" they are trying to record in some definitive way a version of one of his classic works. At one point, one of the assisting musicians asks Monk about a particular note, should he play B or B# at this particular point? Monk glances up at him and says "Either one, just play whatever you want." It was like he was saying, when you're in it, you're in it, and a note here or there isn't going to matter.<br>
                I think that there is something about the contrast property that REQUIRES bad taste NOO vol 1 page 200. No, maybe not, maybe that is just heresy. It's a good one to kick around though...there is something about contrast that causes alternation in tastes. Like I noticed someone said about the last year's International Furniture Fair "The winds of Modernism blow ever more sterile." And in design magazines I start to see a move toward frivolity, humor, anthropomorphism,---anything to try to do something else besides try to invent one more way to pare things down further, to subtract something, which has been the darling approach for quite a while now.</font>

                I work by drawing and dreaming(awake) until I have ideas that satisfy the requirements as interestingly(beautifully, elegantly, surprisingly, inventively, delightfully) as possible. Then I try to figure out how to manipulate the materials to get them to do what I have drawn. Then I sell the client on it from drawings, or if they already trust me, I show them the drawings as a way of showing them what I am trying to do. When I actually start to work with the material, it enters the dialogue too and shows me things that I had not been able to anticipate that increase the interest, so I make use of such discoveries on the way. When finished, I like to say that my work is the result of a 3-way collaboration: 1/3 me, 1/3 the client, and 1/3 the material.</font>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hola Brian,<br>
                Absolutely you do gotta love 'em!<br>
                Like my youngest wife used to tell me when she was turning on the charm, " Sweetheart, it must be so hard for you living in this world.." right ,right, dream on...but girls do have ways of making you believe something that silly don't they?</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">On to wieghtier subjects;<br>
                Last week I built a little shade structure along the back of a house out of (2)2x6beams, (6) 4x4 posts and (~80)2x2 laths. The 4 foot long lath was butted between the beams on 3" centers giving a "cieling" of 16 feet of the 20 foot total. Then we covered the lathed section with white corrugated fiberglass, with only about 2 inches of drip edge reveal, past the 2x6 main beam. No 2x2 lath cross pieces show unless you are close to getting under it. All the wood was prepainted carbon black before assembly.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Goofy?, You bet! I wouldn't have designed or wanted to build that thing in a million years. It was not "me", and never would be.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Let me try to say this carefully...<br>
                The client was extremely pleased with the effect of her design and the execution of the construction.<br>
                She told me how it supported aspects of her minimalist, "edgy" design philosopy.<br>
                I heard from the housekeeper that it had similarities to the old pipeframe shade the client's deceased father had rigged up many years ago when my client was a little girl in this same house.<br>
                I began to feel proud of my work in a way that I hadn't realized was possible. Nothing I could have dreamed up, beautiful and balanced, classic as it might be, could ever get close to the "rightness" and emotional power of this offbeat little creation for my client in this place at this time.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Am I only now, at this late stage, learning this? How could I have been so opinionated and pompous all those years?</font></p>

                You can see an interesting critique of computers as a design tool by Milton Glaser at http://www.icograda.org/web/feature-past-single.shtml?pfl=feature-single-2.param&op2.rf1=56</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Glaser believes that digital design suffers from what he calls a "lack of fuzzyness" which tends to resolve ambiguities too quickly. He feels that there is a dialectic process of ideas back and forth between the designer and the drawing within the fuzzy period that is helpful in arriving at a really good idea, and that computers interfere with this. Something to bear in mind while designing virtual-reality design tools so that you can invent a solution to this matter.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi all:<br>
                Dirk, about the motivation to build a custom dwelling from scratch:<br>
                Tadao Ando, a self-taught Pritzker-prize-winning architect, was asked what motivated him to do architecture, and he replied "Hatred." He was so dissatisfied with the built world that he was moved to build something else.<br>
                I feel a somewhat related motivation, part frustration at what exists, and part pleasure of making things that satisfy and explore my own sense of rightness.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Regarding building inspectors and issues of power, and control of safety, I can offer two stories. One is about Frank Lloyd Wright. When he was working on the Johnson and Johnson Building, his design had some golf-tee-shaped columns that each needed to carry, say, ten tons of load. The inspectors disputed his design and demanded a full-scale test. So a column was built and the test began, but FLW stood right under it as he waved the crane to begin loading the column! When the load reached ten tons, he kept waving for more weight until it approached twenty tons. Each time more weight was put on he tapped the column with his cane, sensing it. Finally he stepped away, but had it loaded more until it collapsed.<br>
                Gaudi had a run-in with inspectors when he had huge columns like elephant's feet protruding onto the sidewalk. As he was adament that there were no straight lines in nature he refused to be dictated to by the sidewalk line, and he just built it over all official protest. Those geniuses...ya just gotta love 'em!<br></font></p>

                Sorry, no more info on United Stand, I looked a little bit a couple of years back, but didn't turn up anything. I will let you know if I run across anything.<br>
                Have not read that Odum book or seen it. I read one book once by an ecologist named Odum who was studying ecosystems in terms of the calories of energy in the sunlight that fell on the land and what the plant and animal populations on that land managed to capture and use. He also showed what the energy costs were to make a solar collector vs the yield of energy from the device and I was disappointed because he seemed to show that technology was not necessarily going to be a panicea for the world. (I had been taught to believe technology was going to make everything right when I used to watch DISNEYLAND as a child.)<br>
                I suggest putting a request to abebooks.com. They will find it used and connect you to a bookstore that has it, and if you like the price they send it to you.<br>
                About multigeneration house sharing, it's done all the time here too, same story --ethnic people co-operating with each other as a family unit. Usually in poor neighborhoods where there is more of an opportunity to break a few rules--the neighbors aren't going to call the cops because they are selling crack, or whatever. Or to fill large apartment houses managers look the other way while Mexicans share an apartment ten ways. I myself confess to, at the peak, sharing a 2 bedroom apartment in Berkeley with, I think 17 people. We all used to skinnydip in the pool. We just had fun like little kids staying over at their friends' house. We participated in a "food conspiracy," group shopping for forty households, divvying it all up and distributing it to each other.<br>
                I read your long past message to Rosemead? Farm on here, which sounded like a well-planned village idea somewhere in Australia. I was impressed by the practical ides for sharing the land, and that there was actually a govt program that encouraged and allowed alternate approaches to how to live together and found a village. I met with a group of county officials about a 27 acre property I am in process of trying to buy. I showed the planner a xeroxed cohousing scheme pasted on the land map and said, I want to do something like this. How do I do it? What language do I have to use? What hoops do I have to jump thru? And she was young enough and smart enough not only to recognize and name the illustration from the book, but to tell me I could do it and tell me the language I needed to express the idea in. Whereas two days before I had talked to a different official, a little older and a lot dumber, and he completely stonewalled me, acted like there was no way to do it within their system at all. So then I took my plan to a hearing with reps from fish and game, water, planning, building, x, y, z--about ten of them in all. I said I want to have a bath house here a theater here, a meditation hall here, a kitchen here, a laundry here, ponds here , here, and here, ceramics, wood, metal, jewelry, weaving studios here, here, here, and fifty teepees located whereever the individuals feel like setting up that dayweekyear. And they as much told me that if I was willing to pay a few thousand to get reports by botanists, archeologists etc., I could maybe do some of what I wanted...so it wasn't completely impossible legally...</font>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Fossil fuel dependency is surely a strong dynamic for change... once it was the 'long term and global effects' of fossil fuel use, but from observation of peoples reactions/actions it seems that the local and immediate effects are equally powerful and the primary drivers for change now... particularly as the local effects (environmental commonly) have effects on health. A few years ago, migrant communities here began hunting kangaroo, mostly after being told by their doctors, and increasingly naturopaths, that they should eat healthy, organic, non processed foods and meats especially. Eating native meats, and foods generally, is no new idea now, but it has been an ideological and ecological position which has been promoted by sections of the 'ecological movement'... ordinary people were not discussing the ecological benefits much, they were just taking their families out and hunting kangaroos cause they wanted to live longer, primarily.<br>
                I agree that things do change...<br>
                Have any of you been able to get your hands on Howard Odums 'Prosperous way down' in the States... its unavailable here... but I have heard it is a worthwile read.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">And about housing, you must have something similar in the US... community... over the years there have been many initiatives here in Melbourne where people join up in small groups, put their finances together, or groups with different levels of finance who have some mutual benefits from coming together and this way they purchase what they can not afford on their own... this gives people a foot in the economy, or housing market at least. But this is nothing new, migrants have been doing this for a long time, Vietnamese families, extended families, sometimes 4 or 5 families are commonly seen living together... they pay off the house, transform their collective labour into equity, give it over to the first family move on to the next and etc... they own and have created some of the liveliest inner city suburbs in Melbourne.<br>
                I have always been intrigued by how many centers, condensed and overlapping patterns there must be in situations such as these... 4 or 5 families in a modest sized house!</font></p>

                Very few of us are afforded this freedom and luxury, I agree. What percentage of us can afford to buy "a house" in California these days? 10%? If you don't have a running start by selling an already-appreciated property to get some of the money, it's impossible for more and more people to begin to get a foothold. Going back to Thoreau's point in Walden, why is it nessary to submit to a situation where you must sign up for thirty years of debt just to put a roof over your head? Once you go down that road it is inevitable that the bankers will own everything, and do. We always got to pay to play, but it seems like the financial powers that be can't resist tampering with the currency, and in the shell game of "what is a dollar worth" more and more people are paying without a hope of being able to start "playing" that is, owning, and even have trouble renting successfully. Greenspan recently told the lucky owners, who are propping up the economy these last four years by refinancing against their "equity" to start thinking about taking ARMs!! (so they can refi just one more time to keep the bubble going a little longer so Bush can get re-elected.) http://www.washingtonmonthly.com/features/2004/0404.wallace-wells.html<br>
                But this week China announced that they were going to "diversify" and stop buying so much US government bonds and buy those of other countries whose currency looks stronger. This could be the beginning of the failure of the paper parachute. Better grease up that Stihl!<br>
                I once saw, and was very struck by, a photo of an African woman, soulfully attired, posing in her hut with her daily implements of living, a few vessels and baskets sitting around her on the mud floor. The thing about it was, any of those implements could have been in a museum. They were beautiful! I envied her standard of living, I felt it was much higher than mine!<br>
                I think CA's ideas are going to help us get back to more beautiful conditions. His "snippable genes" ideas make sense to me for piecemeal shifting changes here and there, hopefully gathering steam as people see the results and start asking for them in their own projects. I think a lot of our current system is supported by easy access to still relatively cheap fossil fuels which, as they run out, will force an end to a lot of waste that is mandated by our current structures. So I think it's going to change regardless.</font>

                Like what really motivates Rob's .01 % to build custom based on Ideals, Unfullfilled fantasies, and let's admit it, Ego gratification?<br>
                Until we probe this aspect of the phenomenon there's no way we can really hope to get a handle on what innovative architecture really is, what it really represents for the people paying the frieght.<br>
                I built a woodbutcher house 25 years ago, and changed it to more of a mainstream dwelling as it progressed over 15 years. It was unpermitted. I milled support girders and windowsill stock with a Stihl .075 from trees on the property. When you're 30 and own it free and clear in America you're doin' the right thing, if that's how you feel!<br>
                But the truth is very few of us are afforded this freedom and luxury. We are intensely social animals and the values /protocols that we can research here on the site will have real impact if they can tap into the mainstream values,. The rebellious fringe will always do what they want and sometimes be our darlings...<br>
                But the real vector of social change happens when you empower people to improve their lives helping them to have power over their world and environment in small, trivial, and large, profound ways.<br>
                One of the Texas Chris's had it right, I think, when he suggested CA and CES should have an HGTV show, at least putting out there in simple form, what some of these important theories might look like in day to day life...<br>
                Rob's notebook is interesting and so is Matt's "projection helmet' he hasn't told you about yet that lets you go to the new site or existing home and mock up projected images to simulate the proposed constructions... hmm..<br>

                I agree with Rob's comments in support of Christopher Alexander's ideas about how to adjust who holds the power in building decisions. CA goes into it in some detail in NOO vol 2, where he describes architects directing tradesmen/craftsmen/artisans in return for an overseeing fee. He thinks if such arrangements work out for all concerned that they will become increasingly used and proliferate. That's how a lot of great cathedrals were probably built. Geoffrey Bawa did some pretty cool stuff--page 141 NOO VOL 2 shows a very cool door by a sculptor in one of Bawa's houses.<br>
                I myself have not had good experiences collaborating with architects or landscape architects or interior designers because I find that they tend to be threatened by my work. For instance I was once called upon to design a firescreen by an architect for their client. When I showed a drawing of my idea to the architect, who was a straight-line, square kind of a guy, he said, "I'm afraid this isn't the kind of thing I had in mind." I said OK and figured, forget it, I can't work within his limits. So, I didn't attempt to send any more drawings. But, he made the mistake of showing the drawing to the customer, who LOVED it and wanted it as the centerpiece of the living room. So I ended up making it and two other things for the house. She just called back, three years later, and told me it's the best thing in her house and now wants me to do a sculpture for the outside garden. So, in that case I escaped with the job, but I have found that if you do too good a job, the establishment is threatened and will try to cut you out.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">During the tenure of Jerry Brown as Gov of California, an interesting thing happened. There were a lot of "freaks" who were living in Mendocino and Humbolt Counties who had gone into the woods and built artistic houses, as in the photos in the book, The Woodbutcher's Art. The county officials started prowling around out there and "red-tagging" (condemning) the houses for code violations. The people got together and formed an organization United Stand which was ultimately successful in getting "Section K" the owner-builder clause inserted in the local codes which said you are free to build as you want to, you just can't sell it to somebody else. I don't know the current status of this matter. It was an enlightened time--Sym Van der Ryn (one of the founding organizers of the first Earth Day) was State Architect and Gary Snyder, the poet, was State Arts Commissioner. I don't know about the current status of this issue. Some people I know just go ahead and build and ask forgivenss later, if ever. But you need enough land to have some invisibility. In some Mendocino neighborhoods, when people see inspectors, they let their dogs out and call the neighbors who do the same.<br></font></p>

                Many of the links don't work, and I imagine this is still under construction.<br>
                I think navigating the notebook section is unclear.<br>
                How do you upload photos and use the sketch pad?<br>
                Naming and connecting the centers is also a little ambiguous, that is the operation of...<br>
                You are introducing new concepts into the language of centeres ie: parents, children, grandchildren, siblings etc...<br>
                We haven't discussed on this website the design of it much. This needs to happen, ie: who is the website going to target, how shall it be structured and designed, how will it work etc...<br>
                For example, if it is going to be for the use of ordinary people, as opposed to the 'converted' or initiated in Alexanders ideas (like ourselves), then my opinion is that I think the site is going to have to be much easier to use, which also has some rammifications for how the language and ideas are introduced.<br>
                At one stage PL.com had an SVG tool on board, I don't know whether you saw that at all, or whether it still exists.<br>
                Another example of interative tools I have seen which roughly work succesfully is the pattern reviewing tools on DIAC-02 Patterns.</font></p>

                I have just done a little experiment... out of 6 people I asked to read at random, a page each from NOO & APL, 6 said that APL made them feel most alive.<br>
                I know Alexanders claim was that the PL were not deep enough, and the sequences, or absence of, did not allow people to build 'generatively', and therefore this was not widespread.<br>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I've been fiddling with the idea of an unfolding-friendly CAD app for a while now. I created a prototype at www.asumendi.com/garden/ where you can walk around a 3d environment and build a garden just by clicking the mouse. (If you check it out, you need a ghz or better processor for smooth movement... the asdw keys move you around).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">A version for buildings, I just wonder if being able to create the drawing is the most important thing -- Mr. Alexander says that he's built many buildings where they unfolded during the design process, but then the measurements were transferred to drawings, and the building built from the drawings -- the result of which was the death of the building. In NOO, I think he mentions something like 'even if you could construct a flower atom-by-atom, would it be alive?' Of course, our intuition is no, it would not.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I'd rather design something that helped people work with these generative ideas, and then have more and more people demand a change in the logistics of building. If you try to work unfolding into the current system, I don't know, seems like a lot of work to create the tool for a questionable end result. So I'm kind of thinking something that starts with a panoramic view of the site, and you can place the natural features, place the stakes for the outline of the house, then start 'sketching' details in 3d space (like what they're doing in proce55ing.net) Get people to realize that this is better, that yeah, maybe they'd rather have a beautiful place for their kids to play or outdoor rooms, as opposed to Corian counters and the oak cabinets.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I guess the question is, if someone is already committed to building a house from scratch, a custom design (i.e. 0.001 of urban and sub-urban Americans at least) then why compromise at this stage in the game? I see that the goal is to allow more people to take part in the process, by making it more affordable, but I don't know. Do most people even have a choice of what their house looks like anymore? Coming from Chicago, it was just 1)builder buys chunk of land 2)builder tells people what they're building 3) people rush to get that house because it's a little further away from the congested madness than anything else. What incentive does a builder have for changing this arrangement? Does the owner of a large development company care whether his employees enjoy their jobs? Does he speak Spanish?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In other words, how do we get the land back from the developers? (In Chicago, our rich clients would pay $400,000 for an old house and knock it down for the lot... I will not be able to afford a $400k lot.) Even here in Bellingham, a city of about 65,000, this is happening, and I imagine this is one of the few towns where there's still some living structure, and people are even motivated to change the system to keep it. I guess I wonder if the cost of *producing* drawings is what's preventing generative architecture -- or is the real cost in the implications of building from a drawing?</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I'm a friend of Dirk's. I'm interested in architecture, but I work as a software engineer. Thanks to Silicon Valley bubble-era title inflation, I once had business cards that claimed me to be a 'product architect', and though this was clearly an example of an employer pandering to the egos of their engineers, I can see that there are many parallels between software design and architecture.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Rob, I really like your site. It's good to see someone using new tools in useful ways.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Someone mentioned _The_Production_Of_Houses_ the other day, and I recalled the difficulties Alexander encountered with the building inspector and city planner/architect people on that project. The building inspector et. al. wanted to see complete 'architectural' drawings of the houses, and objected to the materials and construction techniques that Alexander was using. He seemed pretty upset that they were giving him such a hard time. One thing in particular that stuck with me was his complaint about the drawings. He was doing some of the design of the houses as he went, and said that it would bankrupt the project if he had to have detailed plans drawn for each unique house, and have the plans redrawn each time he modified the house. A while back Dirk observed that he used two ways of creating things - a cut-and-fit approach for some things, and a plastic arts approach for things that could be molded or sculpted. One of the really remarkable things about Alexander's approach was that he blended the two - he was almost sculpting the houses as he went, and used cut-and-fit only where necessary. That made the planners and inspectors uncomfortable, as they were used to buildings being completely planned before ground was broken. The other problem they had was with Alexander's unconventional construction materials and techniques, both of which (incidentally) were very much plastic arts - light concrete vaults supported initially by lathwork and canvas, and building blocks cast out of local soil.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I got to wondering how these sort of problems with the establishment could be overcome without incurring the exhorbitant cost of many changes to drawn plans. First, assume that the building establishment is not going to change, or will only change slowly and reluctantly, so someone who wants to build must accomodate them. Computer modelling of the houses and site could help; certainly there's nothing more plastic than bits. Cost would be kept to a minimum if the modelling software could produce plans that were acceptable to building inspectors and their ilk, though one would have to be careful how often one called the inspector to validate a new set of plans!</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The problem with unconventional building materials and techniques, would be solved if the materials and techniques became conventional. Structural features could be designed by 'real architects' and validated by engineers. So if you want a light concrete vault above a room, pick and place it into your virtual plan. The software will tell you if the distance you are trying to span with the vault is too great. When you have completed a part of the plan, have the program produce a 3D model of it from any viewpoint you like.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">While this is a far cry from the sculpted houses CA made in Mexico, tools like these could put the power to design buildings into the hands of ordinary folks, which would be a welcome change from having to consume an identical house in a vast bland tract. If you've made it this far, well, I surely value your comments!</font></p>

                Dave is one of those great people who has learned from some very tough stuff thrown his way. In my opinion this transcendence is subtly visible in much of his life, this site cetainly included.<br>

                Thanks for the lead on the flowforms. Yes, That guy's work was mentioned in Sensitive Chaos, also. CA shows a picture of one of his watersculptures too. I saw a book in Real Goods describing the work of a European forester who was investigating ways if harnessing energy out of flowing water.<br>
                The story seemed tragic, kind of like Wilhelm Reich's, where there is confusion, (persecution?, paranoia?,) and interruption in the investigations.<br>
                But this forester claimed he had seen rocks in a stream rise to the surface at night under certain conditions due to the energy they were being somehow charged with by the moving water.</font>

                But for the house, it's more about the power of place to elicit the memory of experience and imagination and our ability to assign emotional content there.

                I'm still looking thru the Buddhabrot Images, wishing I had a large wall size one of one of the black and white treatments. That has the same graphic charm for me as those moth wings I enjoyed so much. I get distracted by the Strange Attracter force in them, which I somehow feel personally attracted to. The delightful, fascinating quality of predictable appearances of the Unpredictable--Shiva dancing, is something I recognize again from my interplay with Adi Da Samraj. He has used the phrase "always new" as a description of the Divine, it resonates with me. The fact that this apparently innocuous-looking equation blows into that form of an iconic "Buddha" is amazing. When I first saw it I thought it was some graphics program making interesting modifications of an existing line drawing of a Buddist icon, and I thought it was great then, but the truth is much better!<br>
                I have described the effect I try to produce in my work as a kind of "controlled chaos." My interest in "roughness" comes out of being attracted to the free, non-rote quality of a pattern that is visibly fluxing as it moves, dances. "It don't mean a thing if it ain't got that swing." (quote: Cab Calloway?) I was amazed to read about how the 4th Dimension has exactly that quality of little glitches-"errors"-pulses that throw off its predictability, preventing boredom if you really see what is happening. This is what attracted me aesthetically about the quilts I described in Eli Leon's book, etc. for instance, and in Gaudi's work and Jujol's work. And I might as well add Miro to the list. Thanks for the great lead, Rob, it's very very helpful, just what I was hoping for in this forum!<br>
                One for you guys--Sensitive Chaos, a book by Theodore Shwenk, I believe. Very cool illustrations in the back about wave-form flows of liquids and gases and amazing descriptions of all kinds of examples fron Nature like how rivers flow together (side by side for a surprisingly long way before intermingling....etc.etc.)<br></font>

                We had given this place a pretty good makeover, the past month, and I started to get the realization of the truth of repair, and improvement, as the replacement and maintainance of cellular material, see what I mean?<br>
                The physical material could completely replace itself over time while the form stayed essentialy the same.<br>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">If you follow the link to Melinda Green's site (http://www.superliminal.com/fractals/bbrot/bbrot.htm) you'll see some color images of Buddhabrot that utilize a color palette intended to mimic the Hubble images.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">As for the Buddhabrot in general, I think this is a great example of what Mr. Alexander talks about in Book 2, about every center eventually becoming a void in itself; at least that's the feeling I get from looking at these images. From my (very limited) understanding of Buddhism, that's one of the main ideas anyhow, to become part of the void - so it's a great coincidence the Mandelbrot set can look like the Buddha if you play with it :)</font></p>

Our understanding of natural phenomena strengthens our minds as centers, and strengthens the realities themselves. Our creation of phenomena in the physical world creates external centers... is there a qualitative difference?</font></p>
