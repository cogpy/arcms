        In ancient Greece, the Agora was a place for everyone to go. Philsophers went there to discuss and teach. The market was there, selling meat and fruit and vegetables. Entertainers were there, actors, jugglers, small booths with something interesting for children.
        <p>Food stands, games, entertainment, discussion had a more joyful, but also a more serious side to them, than our contemporary view of shopping centers or community centers -- both deadly in an almost socialistic sense, and largely devoid of juice or humor.</p>
