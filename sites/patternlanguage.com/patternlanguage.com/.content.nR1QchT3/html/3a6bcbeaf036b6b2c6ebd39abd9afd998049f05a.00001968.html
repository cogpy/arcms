          <h4>Let's cut right to the chase: We have a project for a new residence with a very different contract form than what you may be used to; one which puts craftsmanship and innovation back in the hands of the skilled builder. Our contract has the following essential features and advantages:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>You the Builder, are forming a partnership with the Architect.</li>
            <li>You will build a house, fine-designing it as well, from general schematic designs by the Architect.</li>
            <li>The house is about 1700 square feet, with a budget of $250,000 for design and construction. This works out to $150/sf., all told.</li>
            <li>You will be paid 14% of the hard construction cost for your construction management work, and 5% more for your design work.</li>
            <li>These payments are fixed, and cannot be consumed by escalating construction costs.</li>
            <li>You have a contingency fund of 12% of hard construction costs, for safety's sake.</li>
            <li>You control the design and the scope of construction items, as you see fit, within a fixed hard construction cost. The Architect is allowed to comment on your design decisions prior to construction of these items.</li>
            <li>You will have a "kit of parts"- a general construction system we have designed and engineered for flexibility, so that you can adapt and apply it to any changes you may make.</li>
            <li>You will have access to design backup and assistance from the Architect, at no charge, as you request it.</li>
            <li>Early in our design process, you will be involved in the cost-estimating work to ballpark the project. If ultimately you are not awarded the construction contract, you will be paid for your time consulting on these estimating matters.</li>
          </ul>
          <p>Of course, the contract which follows spells these points out in far greater detail, but the fact is, we need to be clear on what we're talking about. We know that there are skilled and meticulous builders, like you, who have paid their dues and should be given the chance to really run the show.</p>
