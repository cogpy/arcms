          <li>Markets have existed for at least 10,000 years.</li>
          <li>Shopping streets in cities -- were invented about 4,000 years ago.</li>
          <li>About 200 years ago we invented the modern metropolis and its shopping areas.</li>
          <li>About 70 years ago we invented supermarkets and the shopping mall</li>
          <li>Neither the modern city shopping district metropolis nor the suburban shopping mall -- and certainly not the auto-strip -- work as living environments. No fun. No family. No really thriving business going on. Merchants only survive.</li>
          <li>Now we are starting to experiment with a new form of living environment: a sustainable, interlaced web of open markets, pedestrian areas, heavily penetrated by cars, but not damaged by cars: places where people want to hang out, not just for shopping, but because it is a really nice place to be, with a sense of shade and sunshine, value and friendliness and fun: you may call it simply THE PLACE EVERYONE WANTS TO GO.</li>
