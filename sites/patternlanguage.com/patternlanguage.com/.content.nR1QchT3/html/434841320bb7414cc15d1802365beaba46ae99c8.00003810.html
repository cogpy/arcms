We have spent decades developing building processes appropriate to our times that will lead to good buildings with strong user participation and sensible spending. We know that there are viable alternatives to strip malls, tract housing and absurdly inappropriate and alienating buildings and we know how to build them.</font></font>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">Now web technology, like Guttenberg's printing press, radically changes the availability of these alternate ways of building. We have formed PatternLanguage.com as an internet corporation, and as an outgrowth of thirty years of work at done at <font size="4">THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURE</font>.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">The web site is dedicated to reaching people of all walks of life who share our concern. In small ways (the design of a garden, the refurbishing of an attic into an extra room), or in larger ways(the revamping of a neighborhood, planning for a new office building), we all play our part in shaping our environment, which in turn shapes us.</font></font></p>

We address both the lay person and the professional architect and builder who have different but largely overlapping needs and who must work together.</font></font></p>
