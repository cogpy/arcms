            <font color="brown">That is really the biggest question. There are many, many thousands of people in the world today, who know that our physical world has been damaged, horribly damaged by architecture and development, and that it continues to be damaged this way.</font>
            <p><font color="brown">To put it half jokingly, "is <i>THIS</i> what we really want around us in the world?"</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown"></font></p>

            </center>
            <p><font color="brown">Millions of people say No. They know that they do not want this. But the forces of development, power, the architectural elite are very powerful indeed. I remember once I gave a speech at the Cooper Union in New York. After the speech, I was invited with other guests to an apartment overlooking Fifth Avenue, for drinks. The man who invited me, and who had been at my lecture, put his arm around my shoulders, walked me to the window, looked down on Fifth Avenue, and remarked how small the people looked, how much like ants. "What do they know of architecture," he said.... somehow trying to involve me in this horrible thought that We were better, bigger, and more knowing than the ants down on the street.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">This attitude of superiority, and its patronizing and ugly tone, has been partly responsible for the fact that we have tolerated the absurdity of what is in this photograph above, and this, below:</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
            <center>
              <font color="brown"><img src="piano.jpg"></font>
            </center>
            <p><font color="brown">So, how can we change it. There are more of us who feel ordinary, than there are of those who feel superior. And above all, the internet has brought us to a new era, where what people want, what they/we truly wish for, can, perhaps for the first time in centuries, rise to the surface, and truly influence, then change, the world. Katrina Heron, the editor of <i>Wired</i> told me recently that she perceived the greatest force of the Internet as being that it would EMPOWER people. "Empowerment," she said, "empowerment,..." again and again.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">And I believe that this is true. For the first time, we may find a force in the world which comes from what lives inside all of us, a way in which our dreams cannot be denied expression.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">It is necessary that we work together, to make this empowerment real, so that deep feelings of ordinary people -- you, me, every one of us -- can truly come to the surface, find expression, and dominate the sensibility of the wold, finally get rid of the silly superficial pretension of buildings like the ones which I have illustrated, so that museum directors, developers, no matter how much money they have, no matter how much power, will give up the pursuit of the non-comprehensible silliness in the name of art, will feel free to admit that they (who have championed it) actually never understood it, never liked it anyway...</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">And above all, with tools like those we are beginning to offer here, people can find expression for their own true voices, which live in them... and we can have a world, not dominated by what people are <i>told</i> they like, but by what they actually DO like, deep down in themselves.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">That is my aim, that is my hope.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">Tomorrow I will write a little more about how we may be able to help one another to make this happen.</font></p>
