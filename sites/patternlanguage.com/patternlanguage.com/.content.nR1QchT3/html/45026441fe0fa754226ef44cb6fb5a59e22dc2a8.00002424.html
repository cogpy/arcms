        <p>In order to give the people of Duncanville a way of finding agreement and the center of gravity of their shared feelings about the envirornment, we provide you with a unique way of achieving this.</p>
        <p>On this website you have access to an online version of A Pattern Language, a book which contains 253 patterns dealing with many aspects of the environment, urban space, building design, and so forth. We would like you to take the time to run through these patterns, in the list provided on the right, and check those patterns which seem to you most important for the future of Duncanville.</p>
        <p>The results of your input, combined with the input of the other Duncanvillians who vote, will be visible at the site clickable below, and these patterns will be rank-ordered.</p>
        <p>Generally, we find that the top 20 patterns already give a very good profile, and show what kinds of issues are on your minds, and may be viewed as a "snapshot" of your city. <a href="javascript:clickWindow('top20patterns.htm','window3')">Look at top 20.</a></p>
        <p>For the sake of a second more detailed view, you may also look at the top 50 patterns, as judged by Duncanvillians. <a href="javascript:clickWindow('top50patterns.htm','window3')">Look at top 50.</a></p>
        <p>This information will be invaluable in helping to steer planning actions, and development. In other parts of this website, you may express your view of the way that future changes and developments should be guided, or steered, by the considerations you all view as most important. On the right is a <a href="javascript:clickWindow('../chrisaprilmay2002/apl/aplcheckboxes.htm','window3')">list of the 253 patterns.</a> Have a look at these patterns, and then, using the check boxes, vote your choices as to which of the patterns you would most like to see implemented in Duncanville.</p>
        <p>You can visit the site as often as you want, to lok at other patterns. The computer will remember which ones you have checked before: it will only count each one once even if you check it on many different occasions.</p>
