    <span class="h2class"><b>COMMENTARY ON ECOLOGICAL RULES (as written September 16)</b></span>
    <hr height="5" color="#FFCC66">
    <span class="h6class"></span>
    <ol>
      In general terms these principles seem attractive and positive. However, as presently stated they contain a core of very big assumptions, not entirely happy in my mind -- because they almost seem to veer too closely to perpetuate the 20th century suburban dream in slightly surprising form.
      <p><span class="h6class">The biggest of these issues are:</span></p>
      <li><span class="h6class">The industrial "park": Separation of work from home. This harks back to the 1970's. I believe the community should consciously encourage work in the home or in attached workshops and offices which are parts of the home, thus reintegrating what the 20th century tore asunder: work and family life. Only very few kinds of light industry need to be rigorously separated.</span></li>
      <li><span class="h6class">There is (at present) a similar separation of park from agriculture, and of houses from agriculture. I have been imagining a far more profoundly integrated weave of houses, gardens, fields, productive fields, meadows for pleasure etc -- but all interwoven with the houses -- not kept separate "over there" in a park. As stated so far, the conception of the park has overtones (unintended, I am sure) of an almost disneylike voyeur quality, that nature is to be looked at at: but through a plate glass window. In my conception, people would be using fields, growing things, working with animals, working outdoors, making productive use of the land around their houses and a little further from their houses.</span></li>
      <li>
        <span class="h6class">And consequently, I would expect to see a finer tissue of interaction between open land and houses/gardens, which gives every single household IMMEDIATE access to the park land and to the agricultural land, continuing the productive relationship which is the real meaning of "oikology", and which will allow people to be happier, more integrated, and communal not merely when they meet in the coffee shop, but in the process of what they are doing together, in streets, paths, fields, and flower beds and orchards.</span>
        <hr height="5" color="#FFCC66">
        <span class="h6class"><b>TO ACHIEVE THIS INTEGRATION: WE NEED INTERACTION OF HOUSES AND WORK AND LAND</b></span>
        <hr height="5" color="#FFCC66">
        <ul>
          <li><span class="h6class">I would state the rule as "Each house is within 100 feet of open land, not more" (open land being defined as a swath of nature or agriculture, at least a few hundred feet wide)</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class">The settlement is laid out so that there is a very long perimeter for narrow ribbon-like compact groups of buildings and gardens, always lying "IN" the land, with open land on either side.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class">Above all, one senses, from every house, and immediate connection to nature.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class">Given the fact that houses will be smallish, and lots also smallish (because of density), the appeal of the place will come from the fact that each person feels that the fields, orchards, gardens, belong to everytone, and belong to each household. This can only happen if people really have all that stuff right outside their own front door; hence the 100 foot rule.</span></li>
        </ul><span class="h6class">From our conversation Russ, I am not sure that you subscribe to this description, and it may be the most delicate issue to have come up so far. I do not want to state my opinion too strongly, until I have seen the land.</span>

        <span class="h6class"><b>CARS AND ROADS</b></span>
        <hr height="5" color="#FFCC66">
        <ul>
          <li><span class="h6class">The way the plan works, should, I believe, allow people normal use of their cars.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class">However, it is to be laid out so that <u>most</u> movement within the site will be on foot or bike.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class">There are no parking lots as such: cars are jammed in among things, with as little space as possible given to the cars.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class">Very little asphalt.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class">Pedestrian paths have dominance in all cluster layout.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class">It is <i>possible</i> to drive from one house to another, but it will be a circuitous route, which does not invite this kind of use.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class">Some cars are gathered together in barns, not so convenient to the houses.</span></li>
          <li><span class="h6class"></span></li>
        </ul>
        <p><span class="h6class">All this is fully consistent with Patrick's statements about cars.</span></p>

        <ul>
          <li><span class="h6class">The overall philiosophy of infrastructure is to put in <i>as little as possible</i> up front, and to use an approach which allows each network to be built incrementally, when needed, not all at once at the beginning.</span></li>
