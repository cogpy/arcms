          <h4><font color="brown">Computers (and this website among others) give us now, in the 21st century -- a way of linking people's desires, interests and wishes in a network of cooperative force to make the world whole, and beautiful to live in.</font></h4>
          <p><font color="brown">It is quite true to say that market forces have done a great deal to destroy the beauty and life of the environment -- that is -- is is WE working within the framework of market forces who have done this to OURSELVES!</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Within this framework ordinary feelings -- yours, mine, and the next person's -- have been cut out of the deal, and the supermarket parking lots, trashy condominiums, highways that are too big, all kinds of stuff that is built only to make money for someone ELSE, have swamped the process by which the world is kept as a living structure for us all to enjoy, and for us to contribute to.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">We are making tools which communities can use so that the planning and recreation of the world, slowly but surely passes back into the hands of common sense ordinary people, acting, with relatively little effort on their part, to insert their voice into the decision making process. If you are interested, have a look at what we are trying to do in <a href="../planning/planning.htm" target="_top">Mariposa County California, in Stafford County Virginia, and in the town of Palos Verdes, California.</a></font></p>
