          <h3>Possibly the most important aspect of what we are trying to do on this website, is to build community. The earth can be changed, in the direction we are trying, only if very large numbers of people help in their own and different ways, to take it there.</h3>
          <p>That requires glue -- the glue that holds people together, so that people can act together -- and that requires discussion.</p>
          <p>This, then, is a rather different kind of community bulletin board -- which is devoted to helping people form associations of interest and intent, to make these things happen in their own communities, and in other places in the world.</p>
          <p>We are about to start setting up such a bulletin board, and would appreciate help from you. If you are likely to participate in such discussion, please let us know any ideas you have about the form that our discussion groups might take. At present we favor bulletin boards, but do not know much more than that.</p>
