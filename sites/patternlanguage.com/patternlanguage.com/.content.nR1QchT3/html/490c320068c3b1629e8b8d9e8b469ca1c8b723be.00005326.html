          <span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66"><span style="font-size:110%">We respectfully request that the Board of Supervisors adopt the following motion, and make it law in Stafford County.</span></span>
          <p><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66"><span style="font-size:90%"><span style="background-color:ff0000">Whereas</span> &nbsp; the citizens of Stafford County have made it abundantly clear that the ills they perceive in the county derive almost entirely from the activities of development and of developers,</span></span></p>
          <p>and</p>
          <p><span style="background-color:ff0000">Whereas</span> &nbsp; the citizens of Stafford County, after being polled on this subject, have manifestly indicated their will to reduce, altogether, further damage to the environment, caused by the activities of developers,</p>
          <p>and</p>
          <p><span style="background-color:ff0000">Whereas</span> &nbsp;the United States Constitution protects the rights of landowners to protect their families and their livelihoods as small businesses,</p>
          <p>and</p>
          <p><span style="background-color:ff0000">Whereas</span> &nbsp;the United States Constitution was never intended to license rape by absentee landowners who do not live or work on the land they own,</p>
          <p>We conclude as follows:</p>
          <p><span style="background-color:ff0000">Unless and until</span> &nbsp;the United States constitution is amended to prevent the rape and plunder of our land by absentee-landowner developers, greedy only for financial gain, by recognizing that the property rights of landowners do NOT automatically extend to development activities when said developers are not resident on the land they own,</p>
          <p><span style="background-color:ff0000">Stafford County now declares</span> &nbsp; that from this day forth, in Stafford County, the rights of property owners to build on their property, so long as they are themselves absent from that land, will not be automatic, and will not be similar to the natural rights granted to land owners who are resident on their land. Instead, all activity undertaken, or proposed by land owners who are absent from their land (that means, who do not live on it with their families, or work on it in their own small businesses), will be subjected to extremely careful scrutiny, prescribed by new laws, and they will be required to prove that they do NO damage to the land and the surrounding land, before they are allowed to build on it.</p>
