                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I've tried for the first time in years to apply CA's ideas to design, in an architectural setting. I won't go into details (e-mail me if you have any questions), but here's what I've learned:</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">1) CA is known, though seen as kooky in contemporary education. I use "kooky" as a catch-all term, because everyone has differing opinions of the man, though it's easy enough to notice that openingly talking about CA is like talking about Bible. People either go really quiet, or a fight erupts.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">2) When using APL, use the methodoly according to the book. Focus on one pattern at a time, in a given language sequence. I selected no more than ten patterns, and have applied three.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">3) Don't mention patterns by name. Do talk about the desired trait or result. You want arcades because you want a transitional space between the outside and the inside, or whatever. Sell your idea in whatever way you can to get the design that is the best.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">4) Keep it simple. Don't go onto the next pattern until you have fulfilled the first one. Build small, simple models, adding detail as time goes on.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">5) Go with the flow. If the instructor suggests something different, go ahead and incorporate it, unless it completely contradicts what you're trying to do. For me, I've gone along with his suggesting, APL-izing it the whole time.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">6) Don't make enemies. If anyone asks you why you're doing what you're doing, explain simply that people like XYZ, and that you want to accomplish that, hence your design. If you format what you're saying into something objective ("People like views"), it forces the other person to consider your statement as FACT, not OPINION. If they disagree, inquire into the facts. By keeping the discussion factual, you can only argue by what is known, not believed. Conversations usually don't go far. The other person loses interest. Who wants to talk about the study that showed that x-amount of people preferred 'Y'?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I haven't presented my project to a public audience. That will happen tomorrow. I will post the results of that.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">A welcome relief to manage a little chuckle after a day or so of working up in the drafting loft trying to formulate a topography of Logic which could fit down over nature with sufficient accuracy to approach the axiomatic.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">It's not about "the two dyad calculus, truth derivatives, or even the logic of statement."<br>
                <br>
                It starts more like: If you see Natural Law operating, there sure as hell has to be something holding it together. That something is connectivity, immutable unchanging, rigor, that which allows relations: Logic.<br>
                The topography is only there as a reflection of the response matter and energy have generated over deep time to the initial intent and the endless subtle "leaning on" that has given direction.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Strong as Nature is she cannot do this in the blink of an eye. We read intent now by the results, The flat featureless empty logic of the creation has become the rich subtle complex matrix that nature and culture show us today. This matrix is an accessible readout of purpose and progress through the 4 domains of Order. We read Order for everthing we know.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The readout will show an unmistakeable rise of complexity, and sensitivity and interaction through time.<br>
                This truth has profound implications for the human place in the continuum.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The periodic table of elements was not an easy thing to develop, even given all the hydrogen and time one needs. That was the begining of another wonderful intangible thing we now possess:..........Patience.....</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">And then, still deeper at the substrate of Nature and existence, rational mind, the power to initiate logic, by imagining possibility and making choices. "The Only thing which can create logic; Mind is an identity with Logic."</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">There it is, that which has yet to be seen.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I want to bring more into the schema in the next few weeks to tie the totality picture together as a working adaptive dynamism where we can see our key role potential more clearly as we look ahead to not the next hundred years as Alexander is fond of saying, but ahead through the next 1000 years.</font></p>

                Turning over the concepts of Order that Alexander and a few precious others have brought to our attention through the years, the temptation is strong to nod, shrug shoulders, and simply go on with our "responding to" style of living.<br>
                We're safe here in God's backyard after all, sit back and enjoy the ride. As well we should.<br>
                Nature, it is said by some, is largely finished with her work here anyway, just a little mopping up to do while we enjoy the wonderful fruits of her millions of years of adaptive creativity: The subtle feelings of emotion and intellect.<br>
                Is the little guy sitting at the keyboard entering the new idea really the most important accomplishment of the cosmos then?<br>
                Could it be this simple?<br>
                Take it away Mr. Clown or whoever, me gotta go to work. I recently took delivery on an old 32 inch bandsaw I have to put back in service so I can use it's sculptural power to make architectural details which will help people be happy, have good thoughts, and pay me because it all works together,....Ah so .<br>

                While standing at the point (A) yesterday and looking up imagining the towers, the fine "looming up" effect grew on me-and the regret that few would see it often from this point.

                In 1962, as a kid I visited the Hearst Castle in San Simeon, on the Central coast of California. Last week, with a short lifetime of experience in-between I made a return trip. The accomplishment of Hearst, his architect Julia Morgan, and the 25 years of efforts by the building crew is as full of value and inspiration as anything you are ever likely to witness. As a 14 year old I was impressed certainly, as a 55 year old it was more like a pride that such a thing could still be done by us as late as mid-Twentieth Century...</font>

In some ways it is a wonderful little demonstration building precisely because of it's shortcomings and lack of integration! There is a very clear illustration of the "Aperiodic Grid" based on the linz cafe in the Book Two on Order, which I have been enjoying immensely since Christmas. You really owe it to yourself, regardless of the expense.<br>

One on one, client to builder, it can be powerful, especially if both parties are somewhat familiar with the goals and means to achieve them.......<br>
                On this site about a year ago, Vasco wrote a pointed and evocative description of one of his colleague's curious but aversive reactions using a dog feeding on "rabbit guts" metaphor which summed things up graphically from a threatened and unfamiliar establishment point of view.<br>
                I loved your allusion to the Romanesque, Mediterranean flavor your work with the patterns tends to generate. I'm not Italian, but I'm sure you've heard that they are quite good at the art of living(!?)..... Anyway, I think that means you are doing things right!<br>
                I got Alexander's second book in the Nature of Order series for Christmas. Coming to a study of Order through Architecture and Mathematics as he has done, I find his comments a fascinating blend of right and left brain synthesis.<br>
                I'm on the site so much and staying here for the duration because I can't find a better, more meaningful, investigation of Order expressed anywhere else, and I want to help Alexander with what he has started. I also want to try to illustrate where the approach can be broadened into other fields since it has such universal importance.<br>
                I think the site here is on autopilot at the moment, I would enjoy Alexander coming on occasionally to reassure us, a little "Star Power" would class things up a bit, eh?<br>
                Best to you Chris, I'm out of town for a few days, hopefully one of the Aussies or the other Texan will drop you a note...<br>
                Later,D.V.</font>

                When we begin to delve into The Event and how the mind interprets it, reads Order into it, and gets meaning out of it, this is a key aspect of the adaptive process operating.<br>
                ALL EVENTS ARE STRUCTURED. And they are structured in a reflection of the original descriminatory criteria which limited the possibilities from an infinity of choices.<br>
                This Universe, this Unity is specific and limited, and therein lies its character and meaning. Therin lies the basis of its 4 interpretive Domains of Order:<br>
                <br>
                # 1. The Rational,[(all of science), we can go on wieghing and measuring things forever, without knowing what they are for].

The Esthetic ( all of art ) Beauty is a powerful informer and bridge between atifact and mind. it tells clearly when things approach perfection in nature and in human craft, but it too falls short of fulfilling meaning taken by itself.... **(Strongly tied to feeling)**</font></p>

                There's more , there's always more, but my kid is hounding me to play tennis, a reflection of the crowded nature of space and time the inevitable conflicts which occur in a crowded system. The boulder falls from the cliff and crushes the tree. Does this mean nature is illogical or unethical? ......... We continue to misread this one; it only means that in a complex crowded space and system there will be competition and conflict. It is a hard Order, struggle is part of the character here.......... Once seen clearly this is a cause for celebration, Taken further it implies a job description for an intelligent species.<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hey Chris, Welcome Back!<br>
                Well, I'm with you on the golden rule-goodwill thing, reminds me of the opposite attitude, an old Alaska bush expression: "ain't no concern to me- ya can't see it from my place".<br>
                In fairness to the Alaskan though, sparse population and escapist self- sufficiency are archaic factors compared to modern architectural demands.<br>
                I like your twin leads very well, in fact I think you can go further with both.<br>
                Check out the spirit of pattern 104 to apply to the "build like it's next door" criteria you suggested as a golden rule confirmation. The concepts of "fitting in" or, "supplying what's missing" and the consequent improvement to existing, adjoining properties is an operating mode with tremendous potential for making our built environment better. "Giving something to the street", should always be part of the plan.<br>
                Your other point is also a great one, and don't limit it to the beginning of the creative action. For sure, goodwill must be there at the inception, but the creative process is alive, dynamic, and adaptive so every theme must over and over show itself in different manifestations and prove its value and survival power again and again through the project, I would say goodwill is no exception...<br>
                When you said "applies in all cases", I was thinking, now here's a guy whose checking things out, and putting something out there. I appreciate you taking that step....<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">If, for the sake of convenience, we do what all known philosophers of the past 5,000 years have done, and divide Order into the four domains of Rationality, Esthetics , Ethics , and Spirituality we can account for all aspects of the observable.<br>
                There's only one small problem: The imperatives of order: repetition, rhythmn, symetry, proportion,equalibrium, harmony, Alexander's 15 "properties", and most likely a few undiscovered ones, only operate on the fist three domains.<br>
                When you cross over to the spirituality side the ball game has rules like; love, hope, faith, and charity.<br>
                If we,re really looking at Order, we've got to look at it all, trouble is, like the old man in Maine said, giving directions, "You can't get there from here"<br>
                Here,s the problem: The order that we are so busy interpreting has all nicely evolved since the big bang, guided and shaped by the aforementioned properties and imperatives. That takes care of physical, artistic, and even behavioral, order pretty well. But it cannot even get a start explaining why human beings know the world is unfinished, know that something irrational like love or faith is worth losing everything, or dying for. And dont't forget humor....<br>
                Beautiful is the rainbow, but on earth it takes the human mind to say so and assign a value like "hope". It's not "in there" without us fellas.<br>
                Like better minds before me I've turned it over a few times, the monkey does love to look at the crystal. After a while though you start to see; this is the stuff that was here first. These feelings and ideas, that we are only now finally in the last few hundred generations beginning to gain access to, must be antecedent to the creation.<br>
                That right there is the kicker: only recently showing up here- around before big bang-maybe there is a little something to this animal that thinks.<br>
                This is "the twist" for humanity and for science to come to terms with. It's a windfall for religion, but a serious rewrite of the script, informed by what we have figured out over the past 300 years, is the only way to cash the chips in.<br>
                We can't go on much longer this way compadres. We've got to use what we got, that's Knowledge and Belief, both deadly forces. It's getting late quick, but we can still get these two together and they can have a helluva life together, and so can the planet after all..........<br>

                One thing that resonated well with me was the cognizance of intuition as a powerful predicter of change and outcomes.<br>
                <br>
                Intuition acknowledgement is key to any open-eyed look at how nature is empowering psychology. We may not know exactly how or why it works but by god, between ourselves, let's admit that it does, and it does beautifully, a lot of the time.<br>
                <br>
                I AM talking about the cue shot in billiards, the home run swing, laying the net in ahead of the fish, the perfect saw cut, or brush stroke, even asking the right girl for the right dance, it's in everything. The fact that we can know it ,and feel it BEFORE it happens is everything.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">This is one of the small powers of mind over matter, something so commonplace that we accept it as just a part of life when things are going well.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Intuition , a much bigger part of our abilities than we have ever acknowledged ,let alone begun to understand up till now...something universal built into experience and the brain's responses, that comes out of the essential structure of stimula and perception in the environment through development in deep time.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I admire Alexander's willingness to look at this and discuss it in terms of "feelings". This is an arena we can no longer afford to ignore. There,s entirely too much raw power here to gloss over and pretend it won't affect the outcome of our efforts here on the planet. It will soon become bigger than all of science, time to get prepared to deal with it boys , and it has been for awhile ,I hate to say....</font></p>

                The mental image brings up another favorite of mine, right up there with Alexander, His name is Masunobu Fukuoka, authored the "One Straw Revolution" in the 70's, and later "the Road Back to Nature". Excellent hands- on and group effort stuff.<br>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Since you're on the topic of tremendous potential, I just though that I'd wade in and say how strongly I disagree. This site is actually hampering the cause, not helping it. People who get interested in pattern language and come here will no doubt get turned off the whole thing.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Part of the problem is technical. This site is impossible to navigate and woefully inadequete compared to current free software that any child could install and have running in a few hours.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">However, part of the problem is also legal. If Prof. Alexander wants his pattern language to be widelly used, discussed, added to and so forth, he needs to disseminate it. That means having it publically available on the internet. Not publically available providing you give me your credit card number and let me charge you some money available. But free, clear, well publicised, and well presented.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I haven't paid for membership for this site, and I'm a practically a diciple of Alexander's work. Think of how unlikelly it is that the mildly interested will do so.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">This site claims that the membership costs are to cover the running of this site. I doubt that this is true. Firstly, it doesn't cost much to run such a site. And secondly if it really is Alexander's intention to provide his language free to the masses, then I'll happilly provide hosting and site maintenance at my own expense, leaving no possible reason for this "paid membership" thing. That's a genuine offer which I'd be more than happy to have the operators of this site take me up on.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Even if this doesn't happen, I'll definatelly be setting up my own pattern language site within the next few months, and if I can't legally present Alexander's work in it's original form, then I'll have to paraphrase it instead.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Greetings Vasko, A legendary heavy hitter of the past!<br>
                Your return could indicate that some thing is starting to happen here- where you been these five months passing?<br>
                ********************<br>
                Success at bringing a group together around some concrete project or activity seems to often hinge on the participants having, like Craig said a week or two ago, some kind of consequential stake in the project. Also, I have noticed that if the work is a little beyond the individual human scale the reward coefficient goes up for participants. Something about being needed and knowing it. Big boats, Barns, Stream restoration Places of worship, come to mind . Teamwork and the resulting comraderie of mutual dependance are powerful drivers during the process while a shared goal or vision of an improved future provides long term fuel for the effort.<br>
                Ownership starts at the conceptual phase as well as the first groundbreaking. One of the tricks is to walk the edge between inclusivity for recruitment, and exclusivity to feed the in-crowd pride strokes.<br>
                There's a lot about leadership here too, recognition that creativity and inspiration are often solitary acts that are greatly enhanced by the group setting .<br>
                Sorry to have to run now, but so nice to leave knowing you are still with this site. Like I told Chris, there's tremendous potential here. I noticed with disapointment recently that Alexander's " Morning Coffee " is repeating itself. This tells me we better smoke the old man out and get the main engine lit off again.<br>
                ..............Best Regards, Dirk<br></font>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I enjoy the abstract ruminations, but I'm too busy most of the time. Here are a few more hot tips from my kit box for you hands on architect types.<br>
                Crown moulding is a beautiful thing, the upside down and backwards part adds mystique, as does the $500 compound mitre saw, but there are a couple of other ways:<br>
                1) The hand coping saw along a line scribed by holding a dummy piece cut at the magic 31.6 degree angle.<br>
                2) The protracter saw guide adjustable square set at 31.6 to give your hand held power saw set on its own 31.6 bevel the straight and true compound angle you're after.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Big,generous base boards are another thing out of fashion now that go a long way toward a comfortable room.<br>
                Don't overlook the possibility of the oversize half-round spline under the trim lintel as a cheap way to add a subtle touch of distinction to door and window casements, alternatively the plain or embossed corner square also kicks some high-end bandicoot, for next to nothing.<br>
                A quick thought that may help on tile floor layouts: Create your pattern like a carpet leaving a nice plain "field tile" border. You can do all your fudging and uneveness here and it won't show especially if you use larger stuff. What can really make this trick work and boost your design's power is to lay in an intermediate border between your design and the field, takes the heat off both sides and really looks like you're dialed into the ancient masters! Speaking of baseboards, a tile one is the only sensible one in a wet place like the bathroom, While you're at it, reward yourself, plug up your tub overflow outlet and see what a full bath can really be, freedom can happen in small ways too, remember?<br>
                Good Day!</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The hands on stuff is great, we need more specifics to empower making positive change in the world and in the psyche that's what this site wants to be about....I think......</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">....Driving up the canyon the other morning I had this glimpse of what we are really involved in here with the study of Order, in nature and the built environment.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I had this sudden clear thought of Logical relationships, the laws of nature if you will, as being in fact empty, concepts and potentials only, having no actual content or existence themselves, until matter, energy, and time, are inserted into them.<br>
                ... Empty Logic, something that Order could evolve out of maybe, but nothing in itself but an endless series of potentials that an evolving reality could depend on to supply boundary controls and consistency. These keys to a future might provide durability and eventually, deepening character.<br>
                As I motored along I realized ,yes this is at least some of what we see here. Alexanders old quote "infinite variety ,endless repetition" came to mind, and I saw the basins of attraction of the Mandelbrot sets, non-linear equations that endlessly repeat within limits but like the natural and handmade things, always unique each time; or the fractal geometry, worlds, within worlds, forever.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">...My old truck started to overheat so I turned off and walked down to the Alameda Creek for some water. I sat near the bank in that timeless place that is every river and saw something else I had missed before. I realized that only in the limitations do the possibilities have a chance to come forth. We are a very specific and restricted case here on this earth. We are not just anything and everything, we are limited and constrained at every turn, and that is what has shaped our universe and our bodies and senses, and our ideas and feelings.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">...The glimpse of esthetic and ethical truth I had about Order boils down to this:........... The human imagination and conscience is the beginning of a readout on why nature is here...........Wow..gulp.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">...I walked back up the trail and filled my radiator and continued on to the jobsite in Sunol. I sawed the young redwood and made something beautiful, or at least nice enough to get paid for. I went home, took care of my woman and kid as best I could, and figured out finally that everything was o.k. I was doing the right thing after all, it was all I could do.................Mahalo, people, d.v.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I like to build it my way!<br>
                An eight penny nail works as well as a twist drill for predrilling, then use the phillips bit for a quick countersink.<br>
                A four inch disc sander is just about like a router for rounding over or chamfering boards.<br>
                Trim boards with generous reveals are more forgiving and add strong interest.<br>
                Mitered corners always open up at the heel used outdoors. A plain 90 degree joint will stay tight for years.<br>
                Saw for clear wood and use short lengths butted to longitudinals on 2',3',or 4' centers for siding, wainscoating or ceilings, ask the Japanese if you don't believe me.<br>
                An outdoor bathhouse is best, attatched or free standing, otherwise put an exterior door in the bathroom accessing a private deck or small porch.<br>
                The kitchen is the active heart of the home, give it visual access/authority over important parts of interior living and important outdoor space.<br>
                A dutch-style split back or side door is a very good thing, if you are brave enough to try it, such a door in the right circumstance can transform the interior and exterior spaces it serves and can bestow great peace and satisfaction with one's house.<br>
                A skylight usually works better than anticipated<br>
                Houses that are comepletely encicled by a nice walkway are quite rare, but generally very pleasant to spend time in and around.<br>
                The most valuable thing about many great houses, expensive and cheap, is how they relate to their surroundings, from within and without.<br>
                Linseed or Tung oil cut with turpentine is an excellent treatment for exterior wood furniture, fences, decks, arbors, and siding, and it can be pigmented for some great effects you will never find at the store.<br>
                When you stretch a design element past the conventional limit it will generally continue to work--but, it will require supporting suroundings to make changes to fit the new effect, to re-establish a new harmony.<br>
                Wood is nice ,White is nice, and so is color. Mix in some stone, tile, and brick. Pay a lot of attention to the light and sight lines and a good house begins to appear. Maybe built perfectly level and straight, maybe not, The more you design and build, the better you and your designs will get, that's just how it works!<br></font>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Yes, with regards to wood I'm in the cur and fit area. Mainly furniture and so forth. Only really a hobby though, firstly I would need to improve my skills before claiming it was anything else, and secondly I'm to much of a perfectionist to work fast enough to make a living out of it.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Interesting that you mention building with the eye and with the hand. In "The timeless way of building", Alexander (the afore mentioned absentee guru) talks about getting rid of all the architects (although he is one) and getting out in the field with stakes and string.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I admit that I have tried this, and it can work very well, especially with a group. However, my preference is probably still to make mountains of sketches and plans. See how many patterns I can squeeze in to each one. Perhaps I over-intellectualise, but I guess it's just the way I think. Other people, like my partner, need to touch something or mark out something. I prefer to do it in my head, or on paper. Of course, my method isn't very collaberative.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">A good point also about the difficulties of designing the commons. Perhaps I'd be best to confine myself, at least initially, to areas that have a smaller group with invested ownership.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">And one final question while I'm here. Alexander talks a lot about continuing his work. Refining the language, coming up with more patterns. Is anyone doing this, or compiling these ideas?</font></p>

I'm on a couple of committees right now, chairing one . Something as mundane as replacing a rotten 100 year old wooden flagpole can stir the spirit of townsfolk to the point of acrimony and distraction.

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Your comments make me smile Dirk.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I'm going to stop talking about alternatives to this website for now, there'll be time enough for that later.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Let's talk about pattern language itself perhaps. For me, the idea of pattern language itself is important, but not life changing. It's a way of representing problems which I guess I was already familiar with (being a computer programmer), and I know that to some extend this was fueled by Alexander's work, but I'm not entirelly convinced that other people haven't had similar ideas independantly. Certainly the entire "think globally. act locally" philosophy carries much the same idea.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Likewise, the other ideas contained in "The Timeless Way of Building" are very interesting, and I generally agree with them, but also not life changing. If it were just for this book, I would discard Alexander's work as being merelly a usefull set of ideas for designing buildings, but certainly not something which I should be advocating in my spare time.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">But then there's the pattern language which Alexander et al present in "A Pattern Language", and I think that it's worth saying that these ideas are tremendously emportant, life changing event. It's generally this book that I push on people, even though it's the second in the series, because when people recognise the universal truth (at least within our culture) of some of these patterns, then much of the ancillary ideas surrounding pattern language in general become self-evident.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Besides, if you want to inspire people to change, you need to show them practical ideas which can be implimented, and ideally have been implimented, not waffle about abstract ideas and fractals. :)</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So I was thinking to myself a couple of days ago, I haven't done much about this recently. I figure what I might do is offer a free short course at the local community house, presenting a bunch of patterns from the book, and with some group exercises to analyse some of the public areas around the community house with respect to what patterns they apply, and which extra ones could be squeezed in order to give them even more life.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Maybe out of that I'll find enough interested local people that we can form a bit of a local pattern language club, and actually go round applying some design patterns in public areas around the town, or at each others houses.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So although I enjoy the abstract discussion, I've had enough of it, and I want to get my hands dirty.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">And here on the internet, there's a place for that too. I'd like to see more research done, not by boffins, but by regular people, on improving the language.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">We need to be using collaberative tools for pattern language development. Computer programmers have been doing this for years now with their pattern languages. Things like wiki's are perfect for this. He's an example:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">http://c2.com/ppr/</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">That one is, as I said, programming patterns, which aint going to change the world any time soon, but the methods they use to develop them will work for us too.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">That's todays rant. :) Your work sounds interesting. My day's mainly going to consist of sitting in front of the computer, although I do have a couple of hours of woodwork to do this morning.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Yo, Craig, I do hear you over there and thanks for the enter twice tip I'll try it. Well the way it shapes up for now there's you, me, and the coffee corner. The beans are good but I'm not sure if they were roasted ,ground, and brewed this A.M., if you get my drift. So we've got an absentee guru, and a couple of guys with a little experience in the ideas who want to work the methods and material a little. Remeniscent of "The Sorcerers Apprentice"........... we're wearing the white coats in Valet Parking , Alexander's car is nice, but we can't leave the lot, is that what you're suggesting?</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I think your graphic art trick worked.

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hey, I could grow into this paragraph making capability, gracias compadre.....<br>
                So , am I getting this right, you and I feel a little like C.A. in that we have had some outward and inward success in applying some personal interpretation of a pattern language, we know it work to some degree, perhaps plenty for ourselves and those we do work for, but we are saddened when we see that the word does not seem to be turning this way with any great speed , and sorry to break the news, but we are going to need some help?? This is sure a piece of why I decided to anchor here and see what happens .</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Intuition, following a lifetime of experience, must at some point be honored, this whole " self mystery " that Alexander is trying to tweak rationality with boils down to this, on some levels. Dyed-in-the-wool, through- and-through we are interprative beings. Thats our whole history in deep and historical time both , in the genetic, and in the cultural. Guys like Alexander and ourselves prove that orientation is alive and well, For me the gift of the Alexander work lies in it's fearless embrace of one simple statement:`````````````````````````</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Very few people are doing this in a meaningful way , a way that can help things go better on all scales. Yesterday you unabashedly used the "D" word, hey, I'm there too, and if you ponder the implications awhile it's inescapable that this stuff forms powerful informing content to a planetary belief system which is lacking specifics beyond the tried and true "Golden Rule" which is our best shot to date, but now slightly blunt and dull for the work we have ahead!</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi there Dirk,</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">You asked how I got nice paragraphs? Well the short answer is that I pressed enter twice every time I finished a paragraph. Are you unable to do that on your machine? Perhaps your web browser treats the enter key as "submit" action or something? Let me know what the problem is exactly and I may be able to help (proffesional computer geek here).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">On to more serious matters, yes it is a triffle quiet here.You talk about working together to figure out how to work it. As far as I can see though, it's not you or anyone else who needs to learn how to use this site. You're doing great. It's the site itself that's broken.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I didn't want to sound too negative in my last post, and I certainly don't want to sound like I'm personally attacking the developers of this site. However, this site is plainly so confusing, difficult to use, and generally obfuscated that I believe that is more of a hinderance to the pattern language movement then a help, and has been for many years. Certainly with no more than a day or two of my time, I could put together something infinitelly better. I'm not bragging here, so could most other web developers.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In fact, even a simple discussion group at yahoo would be infinitelly more usefully to me than this site. However, perhaps I have different motivations to the people running this site. I want to change the world for the better. Sure, I want to see Alexander and his colleages renumerated for their clever work. I've bought their books at significant expense (and they are worth every sent), and I encourage others to do the same. However, I see this as a fairly mundane secondary consideration compared to this 'changing the world' business.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So this information, these ideas, need to be disseminated more widelly. Used, discussed, put into practice in my backyard, and my neighbours back yard, to transform my home town, and my home city, and any other city that wants to join in.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">When I visit this site, I see a few words to this effect, but the overall feeling I get is one of holding back, of shutting people out. Of elitism and commercial interest. The wierdest thing is, I don't think that it's even intentional, it seems to be just a side effect of a poor understanding of the way thay modern web communities work.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Maybe soon I'll just stop winging about the fact that I don't like what other people are doing and just do something better myself. I see that someone owns www.patternlanguage.org. Do you know what's going on there?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">thats enough ranting for now.</font></p>
