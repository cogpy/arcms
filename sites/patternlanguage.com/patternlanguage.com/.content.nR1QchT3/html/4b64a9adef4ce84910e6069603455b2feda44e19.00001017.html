        We begin by describing the large scale structure of the town in such a way that we see clearly how the individual neighborhoods will be embedded in the town.
        <p>Essentially, we may envisage the town as a system of arterial collector roads, with neighborhoods hanging on these collectors like a bunch of grapes. At the center of the system of collectors the town has a square or main center: thus we may see the neighborhoods as hanging on the collector roads, and also connected, by the collectors, to the main square of the town.</p>
        <p>This conception is described in the following diagram, which was worked out together by CES and ISA and Kevin Lynch during discussions of September 1982 in Maracaibo.<br>
        <br></p>

        </table><br>
        <br>
        The critical conditions that must be met, for the proper implementation of this diagram are the following:
        <p>1. The neighborhoods are not too large and not too small. Specifically, we believe that they need an area of about 6 - 9 hectares each. If they are much smaller than that, they do not have enough structure to mean anything. If they are larger, they will become too amorphous and not capable of providing people with local identity.<br>
        2. Each neighborhood has a small central square.<br>
        3. Each neighborhood has one "mouth" where it meets the collector road, and which provides the neighborhood with its entrance. This mouth connects directly to the central square of the neighborhood.<br>
        4. The neighborhood has a collector along one side only, and remains open for growth and development on the other three sides. The neighborhood must not be surrounded by collector roads.<br>
        5. Local traffic within the neighborhood is extremely slow and mainly pedestrian.<br>
        6. There are a few small local link roads and paths, from one neighborhood to the next, but these are always minor, and are placed so that they never destroy the function of the main square and the mouth of the neighborhood as its primary channel of movement to and from the outside wurld.<br>
        7. As the town grows, new neighborhoods and new collector roads may be built to extend the population and area of the town, but always in such a way as to preserve the essential structure defined by these few parameters.<br></p>
        <p>The Guasare master plan, prepared by ISA, has been written in such a way as to guarantee that these seven conditions will be met.</p>
        <p>The following drawing represents one version of the ISA master plan, which is intended to meet these seven conditions. The first two neighborhoods which are to be built in this plan are designated by shading and marked 1 and 2.</p>
        <p>The following report describes the production of houses in all neighborhoods, but frequently uses the specific details of neighborhoods 1 and 2 as examples.<br>

        </table>We shall now define the global structure of the neighborhood. We may summarize this structure by stating certain general rules for each neighborhood. The form of each neighborhood which is created by these rules may be summarized by means of the following diagram.

        </table>
        <p>1. We assume that each neighborhood is served by a main street, which opens like a mouth, from the main artery outside the neighborhood, at right angles to the artery. This conforms to a common pattern of markets, visible throughout Latin America.</p>
        <p>2. We assume that this main street is wide and pleasant, probably with trees. It may have pedestrian traffic down the middle, or down the sides, or both, but it also allows for the passage of cars.</p>
        <p>3. The main street leads to some kind of square, or wider opening, or park, in the middle of the neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>4. At this point there is an important public building, preferably a church, if this is still realistic, otherwise a school, or other public hall of some kind. In some cases, school, church, etc., although appearing as a main building in one neighborhood, may serve another next-door neighborhood which has a different public building at its respective center.</p>
        <p>5. This public building is elaborate in some important sense, in that it contains feeling and ornament, and has the capacity to function as the psychic center of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>6. Opening off the main square of the neighborhood there are a number of secondary streets, five the maximum, depending on the size and shape of the neighborhood. They are rather long and straight streets, and they provide for the main vehicular traffic in the neighborhood. The secondary streets are located in the neighborhood in such a way as to allocate equally the main vehicular traffic in all different parts of it.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td align="center">ACTUAL NEIGHBORHOOD 1:</td>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>7. The secondary streets are given a slight angle, off the grid, so that they are oriented by a few degrees towards the middle of the neighborhood. Thus, although they will tend to be roughly parallel to the sides of the neighborhood, they are given a slight radial bias to make them lead, psychologically, more strongly to the center of the neighborhood, and to create a closer feeling between individual houses and the center.</p>
        <p>8. The width of the secondary streets varies from 7 - 10 meters. At the points where the secondary streets reach the boundary of the neighborhood they become narrower, so that they do not allow for main vehicular access in and out from the neighborhood at these points. Some of the secondary streets could possibly turn into pedestrian streets for about 30 - SO meters before they exit the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>9. Opening off the secondary streets there are tertiary smaller streets which are primarily for pedestrians, though they allow for limited car traffic, when necessary. These smaller streets are, in effect, pedestrian streets, that are narrow enough to allow car movement and parking without danger to children.</p>
        <p>10. These tertiary streets are about 4 - 6 meters wide; they are rather short, and there is a gate at the point of their entrance.</p>
        <p>11. Some of these tertiary streets reach the boundary of the neighborhood and pass through a small gateway to the next-door neighborhood. Others terminate within the neighborhood itself.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td align="center">ACTUAL NEIGHBORHOOD 2:</td>

        </table>
        <p>12. The smaller tertiary street has an intricate structure and shape, generated by its adaptation to the configuration of the site and by its intention to give access directly to the house volume and not to the garden of the house. Therefore, the tertiary street allows easily for change of direction, for change of street width, for the occasional formation of very small, almost tiny squares at the points of change of direction or at their ending points.</p>
        <p>13. The streets and public open spaces of the neighborhood will be created with one major concern in mind: to make them lively, in the right and appropriate scale for people walking along them or sitting there. Therefore, public open spaces have not been separated into distinct areas for cars, others for pedestrians, others for parking, and so on, an arrangement that tends to bring them to disproportionately large dimensions. The streets of the neighborhood provide for all these different activities and functions in a unified way, reflecting concern to create livable and human streets and squares.</p>
        <p>14. There are no parking lots in the neighborhood, since they create dead areas in the fabric of the town. Parking will be provided along the main, secondary, and tertiary streets. The existing length of these streets provides for one-side parking for about 150 cars, about 70 - 80 per cent of the houses of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>15. Each neighborhood contains one builder's yard, a building supply store, subsidized by Corpozulia, which will provide many houses with materials for construction, and also provide professional assistance in construction.</p>
        <p>16. Many houses in the neighborhood are given the opportunity to have a small local shop at the front of the house.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>One of the most crucial aspects of the neighborhood is its density, directly reflected in lot size.
        <p>In the early studies of Guasare, and especially those undertaken by the urban design group in Maracaibo, the lots proposed tended to be small and narrow--something like the traditional city lots of Santa Lucia.</p>
        <p>The assumption inherent in these lots was that, because of their narrowness, they would have a continuous built frontage, and would therefore produce a stongly "urban" character. Since modern developments are so often characterized by loss of coherent space, and loss of coherence, this desire on the part of the urban designers was understandable.</p>
        <p>It is, nevertheless, we believe, quite strongly mistaken as a direction for the project.</p>
        <p>The studies made by the financial group (Echenique et al.) have clearly shown that lot size is one of the principal factors that will attract people to the Guasare new town. The location of this new town is not especially desirable. People will not choose to live there unless it has some clear advantage over other places. In the Guasare region, the most obvious advantage that can be given is, quite simply, size of land.</p>
        <p>Careful inspection of the present developments in the Guasare region, and their character, points in the same direction. The character is above all rural. There are trees, animals, groups of small outbuildings. The land around a house is not an urban "yard" or "garden" but a potentially productive area, which can produce food for the family (in the form of vegetables or animal care), and can also provide incidental space for various kinds of economic activity (storage of tires, machinery, building supplies, etc.).</p>
        <p><u>This points, unequivocally, towards a relatively large lot size for the houses of the new town.</u></p>
        <p>Furthermore, it is clear that the regional character, with its intense damp heat and very slight breeze, strongly requires a format, or layout which is as open as possible, to allow breeze to circulate, and to maintain a reasonably open character. This means that lots must not be long and narrow (as they are in higher density towns, or in other regions of Latin America), but must be as close to a square as possible, since this will increase the openness and pleasantness of each lot and its associated garden. This rather obvious point about the shape of the lots must be firmly underlined, since tendencies of conventional urban design theory may lead to long, narrow lots, for the reasons stated. We believe that construction of long, narrow lots in Guasare would be an extremely drastic mistake.</p>
        <p>After studying these factors carefully, we have come to the conclusion that the average lot should have a size of about 470 m2, and that this lot should never be less than about 15 meters wide. If the lots were rectangular, this would imply a distribution of lots ranging in shape from 15 x 30 m to 22 x 22 m but always relatively wide, so that the breeze can flow comfortably through the lot and through the house.</p>
        <p>However, as we shall see in the next section, more careful consideration of the same factors indicates that these lots should not be simple rectangles, but should be composed of two adjacent rectangles, one approximately 11 m x 11 m and the other approximately 16 x 22 m, making a total of 470 m2 for the two parts together.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>We are now ready to describe the microstructure of the project in detail. By microstructure we mean the detailed local arrangement of lots.</p>
        <p>In most modern neighborhoods, the lack of feeling and endless sense of sameness is aggravated by a type of layout in which exactly similar lots and houses repeat themselves, block after block, in an unending repetition in which it is extremely difficult for individual persons to feel their own uniqueness, or to feel themselves at home.</p>
        <p>This problem cannot be solved artificially by merely changing layout in a random fashion, since this merely produces an equally strange sense of unreality, which does not help the problem at all.</p>
        <p>What is needed is a clear understanding of deep structure, which generates variety in a natural way, so that each part of the town becomes unique, for good reasons, which make intuitive sense, and which create an authentic and profound sense of individuality at each point.</p>
        <p>In this project we believe that we have finally reached a breakthrough in modern housing planning by identifying a series of assumptions which, taken together, do produce just this kind of organic variation, in an authentic way. These assumptions are the following:</p>
        <p>1. We assume that each house has a garden.</p>
        <p>2. We assume that the house itself, is a compact cluster of buildings which are built around an open courtyard or patio which communicates with the garden.</p>
        <p>3. We assume that the controlling factor which governs the location of a house, with respect to garden, is the wind direction... since breeze and cooling must play the governing role in a house correctly adapted to the climate of the Maracaibo region.</p>
        <p>4. We also assume that each house, itself, arranged around its patio, is a compact and beautiful entity, with a reasonable sense of enclosure and identity.</p>
        <p>5. We also assume that the garden, outside the house and patio, must itself be a compact and sensible shape, suitable for agriculture, trees, children playing, and other uses. This requires that the garden itself must also be a compact and simple shape, so that land is not wasted in narrow strips around the house.</p>
        <p>6. We assume that the street system will not govern the organization of the neighborhood, but that an adequate pattern of small streets can be adapted to the house lots, once the pattern of the house lots has been determined in such a way as to meet the previous considerations.</p>
        <p>On top of these assumptions, what we have done, quite simply, is to identify a series of rules which must influence relative layout of house, garden and street in such a way that the interaction of these rules produces a syncopated, non-repetitive structure because their interaction is so complex, and because it also varies naturally from point to point in the terrain.</p>
        <p>The rules we have identified are the following:</p>
        <p>1. The house is a courtyard structure of about 11m x 1lm and covers an area of about 120 m2. This area includes both house and patio.</p>
        <p>2. The garden is an area about three times as big, that is, of about 350 m2 additional.</p>
        <p>3. Each of these two areas must, as far as possible, preserve its integrity as a positive space. This means that the lot (house plus garden) is not necessarily a single rectangle, but must be seen as a joining of two rectangles, one about 120 m2, and the other about 350 m2.</p>
        <p>4. The house and patio are open to the garden, and there is a natural view through this opening from the house patio into the garden beyond.</p>
        <p>5. The location of the house is clearly known at the time of the lot subdivision. Thus at the time of lot subdivision, the position of the house on the lot, and the position of the garden are already defined. This is an unusual practice, since in normal practice, the house may usually be placed anywhere within the setback in the lot, within the setback limits. In the system we are proposing, the actual position of the house will be defined at the time of the subdivision.</p>
        <p>6. The relative location of house and garden in any given lot is determined by two factors: the slope, and the wind.</p>
        <p>7. In general, if the house is on a slope, then the house is placed uphill, and the garden is placed downhill. This is essential, since a house with a garden uphill from it creates a very unnatural situation which strongly inhibits use. It means that the line connecting the center of the house and the center of the garden should be as nearly as possible at right angles to the contour lines.</p>
        <p>8. In the case where the land is flat, the house and garden are placed in such a position that the prevailing breeze blows from the garden into the house patio, and then into the house. This requires that the line connecting the center of the house to the center of the garden should be as close as possible to the line of the prevailing breeze.</p>
        <p>9. In the hilly case, where we require the house to be up the slope from the garden, the breeze will also blow from the garden into the house, since on hills breezes most often blow up the hill anyway, and have a direction which is governed by topography, not entirely by the overall direction of the breeze in the region. The two previous rules are therefore consistent, since both create conditions where the breeze blows from the garden into the house.</p>
        <p>Although these rules are quite elementary, we have discovered that the interaction between these rules, when they are carefully followed, produces a highly assymetrical, syncopated structure of the type illustrated in the following diagram.</p>
        <p><br></p>
        <table align="center">

            <td align="center">LOT SUBDIVISION AND STREETS IN A PROTPOTYPE NEIGHBORHOOD</td>

          <tr>
            <td><img src="lotsubdiv.gif"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>In order to create this structure, it is necessary to build it up one lot at a time by paying attention to the rules.
        <p>If the rules are followed strictly, then lots will, in general, not be rectangles, but coupled pairs of rectangles, which are in line with either slope, or prevailing breeze. The overall structure is <u>unpredictable</u>, because the local interaction of the rules creates an aperiodic structure in an entirely unpredictable way.</p>
        <p>In order for the rules to work effectively, it is essential that the two rectangles which represent house and garden respectively be as pure as possible. The functional reason for this is that the positive space thus produced is more useful and calmer in its nature. This means that arrangements in which the garden forms an L-shape are ruled out as far as possible.</p>
        <p>Once the general structure of lots has been arrived at in this way, local streets are then introduced between the lots in such a way as to follow three further rules:</p>
        <p>10. Every house fronts directly on the street. This means that the edge of streets is made of houses, not of garden walls, and pro- duces an important social feeling in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>11. The total length of streets is as short as possible.</p>
        <p>12. In order to reduce street length, and reduce the cost of services, it may be helpful to relax rule 10 slightly. If we allow ten per cent of all houses to be off the street, and to be approached by a front path through the garden, it then becomes possible to reduce total street length from about 17 meters per house to about 12 meters per house: an enormous saving, which makes the layout more economical.</p>
        <p>The resulting neighborhood structure has a simple and almost endless variation, which is extremely charming. When we combine this layout with the sense of physical streets that is described in chapter 4, we believe that we have for the first time solved the problem of combining modern techniques of subdivision that are necessary in a rapidly growing new town with the charm and delightfulness that make each person feel at home in the uniqueness of their own lot and the uniqueness of their own street.</p>
        <p>The precise rules and procedure for layout are specified in detail in the next section.</p>

        <p>The archetypal form of neighborhood, which has been described above, will take different forms in each of the different neighborhoods of the new town. This will happen because each neighborhood must be adapted to a specific set of conditions which vary from one neighborhood to another. The following factors will control the overall form of the neighborhood:</p>
        <p>1. Its size.</p>
        <p>2. The location of arteries along its boundary.</p>
        <p>3. Its topography.</p>
        <p>4. Its orientation with respect to the center of the town.</p>
        <p>As a result of the interaction of these four factors, with the general structure described in the last section, each neighborhood will take on a unique configuration. For example, we show the first two neighborhoods, below. Each one has its particular configuration as a result of its unique combination of size, shape, bounding arteries, topography, and orientation.</p>
        <p>We shall now present the organized steps which are needed to generate the interaction of the structure, and local factors, for a particular neighborhood. In order to create the neighborhood plan it is simply necessary to lay out each neighborhood, step by step, in the sequence presented below. We propose that this work be done directly by planners or architects of Proguasare, possibly with the help or consultation of CES (the authors of this document).</p>
        <p><u>All the following steps must be done on the site itself, after careful inspection and feeling for the actual place.</u></p>
        <p>RULES FOR THE LAYOUT PROCESS</p>
        <p><u>STEP l: DEFINE THE SIZE AND BOUNDARIES OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD</u></p>
        <p>After the general position of the new neighborhood has been selected, spend some time trying to understand the reality of the site and its configuration, slopes, ravines, big reees, small rivers. Then, having in mind that the size of the neighborhood varies between 6 to 9 hectares, try to find out where the most natural boundaries of the neighborhood will be. At least one of the boundaries of the neighborhood must be defined by an existing collector road, or by the extension of an existing collector. Ravines or small rivers, or pronounced changes in the direction of slopes on the ground will naturally define some of the boundaries of the neighborhood.</p>

        </table><u>STEP 2: LOCATE THE MAIN ENTRANCE TO THE NEIGHBORHOOD</u>
        <p>Along the collector that defines one of the boundaries of the neighborhood look for the place that will be most appropriate=for the main entrance into the neighborhood. This place will have to provide for access towards the main square of the neighborhood, and will therefore have to be somewhere close to the middle of that part of the collector road that shapes the boundary of the neighborhood. It should also be a place that would seem the most natural as a turning point from the collector road into the neighborhood. In case there is more than one collector road along the boundaries of the neighborhood, the main entrance should be placed along that collector which has the stronger link with the central square of the town.</p>

        <p><br>
        <u>STEP 3: LOCATE THE MAIN SQUARE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD</u> Now try to find the best place for the main square of the neighborhood. It should hold an area somehow central in the neighborhood, it should be clearly visible from the collector road and therefore not too far from it, and it should be on a place that is beautiful, probably flat with some big trees, probably also it could be a high place in the neighborhood compared with the rest. The place that you will identify should feel large enough to contain the main square of the neighborhood, whose size will vary between 20 x 45m to 25 x 60m, depending on the size of the whole neighborhood.</p>

        <p><u>STEP 4: LOCATE THE MAIN STREET INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD; THIS STREET LINKS THE MAIN ENTRANCE INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD WITH THE MAIN SQUARE</u></p>
        <p>At this stage you already know the position of the main entrance, and the position of the main square. The next step is to create a link between them. This link will be the main street of the neighborhood, and the only vehicular street that will provide direct access into the neighborhood. This main street into the neighborhood is one of the widest streets of the neighborhood, its width depending on its length, with a two-way vehicular lane, and with wide sidewalks with trees. Or, in some cases, it can be made of two separate vehicular one-way lanes on either side of a wide pedestrian "alameda" in the middle, planted with trees.</p>

        <p><u>STEP 5: THE CORNERS OF THE MAIN STREET AND THE MAIN SQUARE</u></p>
        <p>At this stage you know the position of the main entrance, the position of the main square and its approximate size and shape, and the position of the main street that links the main entrance to the main square.</p>
        <p>Now you must shape these places precisely on the ground by putting stakes on the corners of these places, and by extending a thick rope along their sides. It is necessary to do this in order to experience the feeling of these places as accurately as possible.</p>
        <p>First, place two stakes where the main entrance into the neighborhood is. These two stakes will have to mark the width of the main street that will vary between 10 to 15m, depending on its length. Imagine that at this place will be a gate to emphasize the point of entrance into the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Now, shape the main street that will lead from the main entrance to the main square. Place the main street as nearly perpendicular to the collector road as possible; that will give a more natural way of entering from one place to the other. However, a slight angle may be necessary because of the topography of the site. Extend two ropes along the two sides of the main street, all the way from the main entrance to the main square. Walk along the main street, imagine one-storey houses touching each other on both sides, and also distinguish the vehicular lanes of the street from the pedestrian areas, probably by laying some ropes on the ground. Walk up and down on this street several times trying to get its scale right. You might have to adjust its width or its length slightly until you fet it to feel right.</p>
        <p>Now proceed to the staking of the square. Place four stakes in its corners and extend rope along its four sides. Try to get the scale of the main square of the neighborhood right. Think that it is not the main square of the whole town; therefore it should not be so big as to compete with the main square of the town. Also it should not be too small, so that it can receive the activities of the neighborhood. It should be an intimate place, not too big, not too small, surrounded mainly by one-storey buildings. Think also of the area to be given to pedestrians, and of the area where vehicular traffic will mainly occur.</p>
        <p>You may have to go through several small changes and admustments until you get the right size and shape of the main square and the main street.</p>

        <p><u>STEP 6: LOCATE THE VEHICULAR SECONDARY STREETS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD</u></p>
        <p>The vehicular secondary streets are 7-10 m wide and they provide the main vehicular circulation in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>There are three criteria that will guide the location of the vehicular secondary streets in the neighborhood:</p>
        <p>a. All the secondary streets will have to lead in some way to the main square of the neighborhood, and none of them will exit directly to the collector road or to the main street of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>b. The location of the secondary streets will be guided by the configur- ation of the ground. A secondary street could be on the ridge of a small hill, or it could follow as closely as possible the same con- tour line.</p>
        <p>c. The secondary streets should be located in such a way that they serve all different parts of the neighborhood in an equal way.</p>
        <p>There are 3-4 vehicular secondary streets in each neighborhood. Globally, they must be placed to create a radiant kind of configuration, all of them converging towards the main square. Sometimes a secondary street can lead into another secondary street that then leads directly to the main square.</p>
        <p>First make a decision about the approximate locatin of the secondary streets, and specify the way they will lead to the main square. Try to form a simple pattern of secondary streets. Walk along them, and visualize them by laying ropes along their edges. After you have walked along them several times and have become familiar with them, and probably after some changes and adjustments, you will start to have a better understanding of all the secondary streets of the neighborhood as a whole. When you feel they are right, make good sense, and create a simple and coherent pattern, put some stakes along them to finalize your decisions.</p>

        <p><u>STEP 7: PLACE THE PUBLIC BUILDING OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD ON THE MAIN SQUARE</u></p>
        <p>Now choose a place on the main square where the public building of the neighborhood will be. It should hold a prominent and appealing place and its location on the square should be such as to contribute the most to the wholeness and liveliness of the square.</p>
        <p><u>STEP 8: SUBDIVIDE THE AREA ALONG THE MAIN STREET AND AROUND THE MAIN SQUARE OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD</u></p>
        <p>The first part of the neighborhood to be subdivided is the area of the main street and the main square. These two places are the densest areas of the neighborhood, since they form its center. Therefore, it is mostly the houses themselves, and not gardens, that will form the sides of the square and the main street.</p>
        <p>Make the lots along the main street and around the main square narrow and long; their frontage should be 10 - 12 m wide, and they should be about 35 m long. The part of the lot facing the street should be given to the house. The houses will form a continuous frontage, most of them touching each other.</p>

        </table>
        <p><u>STEP 9: IN EACH NEIGHBORHOOD IDENTIFY THE DISTINCT LOCAL AREAS TO BE SUBDIVIDED IN SEQUENCE ONE AFTER THE OTHER</u></p>
        <p>The main and secondary streets of the neighborhood, located already on the site, define distinct areas in the nieghborhood. The boundaries of one area are defined either all of them by secondary streets or by a combination of main and secondary streets, and in some cases by the collector road too, depending on the actual location of the area in the neighborhood.</p>

        </table>
        <p>Now start subdividing one area after the other. In the following steps we will demonstrate the steps that have to be followed in the subdivision of such an area.</p>
        <p>We choose local area #1 as an example to show the subdivision process in its detailed sequential operations.</p>

          </tr>
        </table><u>STEP 10: START THE LOT SUBDIVISION IN THE LOCAL AREA</u>
        <p>This step of the layout of the neighborhood is the most crucial. All the microstructure of the neighborhood, its small streets and paths, and small local squares which will serve each specific area of the neighborhood will be established. During this step it is necessary to accomplish two things simultaneously:</p>
        <p>a. Subdivision of lots</p>
        <p>b. Location of smaller streets and local centers that will serve each area of the neighborhood defined by the main and secondary streets.</p>
        <p>These two things will happen step by step in a series of cycles, as we shall see:</p>
        <p><u>STEP 10a: First you try to get a good feeling of the local area to be subdivided.</u> What its boundaries are, the already subdivided areas along the main and secondary streets, if any, where the wind blows from, the configuration of the land with its slopes, important trees and views, etc. In the example that we present the situation is the following:</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="rules10a.gif" w="400"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><u>STEP 10b: Now you start creating lots, in groups of 5-10 lots at a time.</u></p>
        <p>You do not lay out all the lots in the local area as one step. Together with the new lots a piece of street to give access to them will be laid out also. In cases where the street to provide access to the newly laid out lots has already been located, the lots laid out along it will have to pin it down and form it carefully.</p>
        <p><u>STEP 1Oc: Now you place the first group of 5-10 lots, using the following principles:</u></p>
        <p>Each lot consists of two clearly defined entities; the entity of the house, arranged around a patio, and the entity of the garden. Both of them have compact and simple shapes, and usually they are rectangles. The area of the house is on the average about 120 m2 and the area of the garden about 350 m2 . However, there is a wide range of variation concerning the size of the lots. There are two controlling factors which govern the location of the garden with respect to the house:</p>
        <p>1. The wind direction: The garden is placed on that side (or sides) of the house that allows the wind to blow from the garden into the patio and the house, and the center of gravity of the garden and the center of gravity of the patio of the house thus forms a line that approximates the direction of the wind.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="rules10c.gif" width="500"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>2. The slopes of the site: for houses that are being located on the slopes of the site, the location of the garden with respect to the house won't be guided by the direction of the wind, but by.the slope: the higher part of the lot will be given to the house, with the garden being located on the lower parts of the site.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="rules10c2.gif" width="500"></td>
          </tr>
        </table><u>STEP 10d: The drawing, and legal specification of each lot, must contain both the house and the garden, clearly shown as separate entities.</u>
        <p><u>STEP 10e: Next, you place a segment of tertiary street, which gives access to these 5-10 lots.</u></p>
        <p>In order to place this segment of tertiary street you have to bear in mind the following general rules about tertiary streets:</p>
        <p>a. Each tertiary street consists of distinct smaller segments of street, connected together in such a way as to create a coherent whole with a clear structure. The structure of the tertiary street can be described as follows: each tertiary street has its main segment, stem-like, that starts off the secondary street and extends deeply into the local area. Off the main segment of the tertiary street smaller segments, branch-like, ramify into different parts of the local area in order to provide access to all houses.</p>
        <p>b. Along the tertiary streets various small local centers can emerge, a widening along the streets, or a small place at the meeting point of two smaller segments of street. These are places for children to play, or for people to sit under trees.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="rules10e.gif" width="350"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>c. Car movement between neighborhoods never occurs along tertiary streets. Therefore, each tertiary street, regardless of its possible continuation into the next neighborhood or its termination within it, is a dead end for cars, and should be arranged in such a way as to provide for turning points for cars, usually in the form of a miniature T-street junction.
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="rules10e2.gif" width="210"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>When a segment of the tertiary street is being placed and shaped, two conditions must guide the actual operation of shaping the segment:
        <p>a. The segment of the street, by itself, is a clear entity, with its own good shape, its own direction governed by the site configuration and by its intention to give direct access to the house volumes themselves rather than to their gardens. A segment of the street will be fully established through a sequence of steps; some lots in the beginning will hint at it, at its approximate location and shape, and then some other lots which will come later will pin it down, give it precise dimensions and shape.</p>
        <p>b. The segment of the street is part of the whole tertiary street system and it has to contribute to the making of a well-structured and coherent tertiary street network in the local area. Therefore, when laid out, its connection with the existing segments of streets is very important. There is a hierarchical and sequential movement from the secondary street into the main stem of the tertiary street, then into a smaller street that branches off the main stem, and possibly into even smaller paths that ramify off this branch.</p>
        <p>Each segment is placed in such a way as to meet these conditions as well as possible.</p>
        <p><u>STEP 1Of: Now you repeat the cycle of steps l0c, l0d, and 10e, over and over again, until the whole area is subdivided.</u></p>
        <p>In order to explain this, we now illustrate a sequence of six cycles, which simulate the lot subdivision of area #1 that we have chosen to present as a detailed example, with the necessary explanations of details.</p>
        <p>CYCLE 1</p>
        <p>First group of lots. This particular part of the area was chosen to be subdivided first because of the rather irregular land configuration. The slope of the ground dominates the wind on the layout of these lots. First part of street is hinted at, not yet clearly nor fully defined.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="cycle1.gif" width="350"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>CYCLE 2</p>
        <p>Second group of lots is laid out, again following the requirement about the slope. A new piece of street is laid out also. It is a continuation of the street located in the previous step, and it connects with the secondary street. These two parts of street will form the main stem of the tertiary street that will lead from the secondary street into this area.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="cycle2.gif" width="350"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>CYCLE 3</p>
        <p>This group of lots lies on a flat piece of land, and therefore their layout is governed by the rule about the wind. The first ramification of the tertiary street is hinted at, with a small widening at its end suggested by the layout of that particular corner lot that forms it. Also a small alley in between two lots has been laid out to provide access to the lot at the back.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="cycle3.gif" width="350"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>CYCLE 4</p>
        <p>Lots are laid out now along the main stem of the tertiary street. Their precise layout will pin down the street, will give it its width and shape. Anew branch of the tertiary street is hinted at to provide for the way into the unsubdivided part.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="cycle4.gif" width="350"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>CYCLE 5</p>
        <p>Most of the lots of this step are on a flat piece of land, and those which are on slopy land, the slope does not oppose the direction of the wind. Therefore all of them are laid out according to the direction of the wind.</p>
        <p>The second ramification of the tertiary street is pinned down and it takes the form of a small square, which will continue to some smaller paths already hinted at.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="cycle5.gif" width="350"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>CYCLE 6</p>
        <p>The last lots of the area are laid out. They fill out unsubdivided land, and they pin down streets already hinted at before.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td><img src="cycle5.gif" width="350"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><u>STEP 11: AFTER THE SUBDIVISION OF THE LOTS IN THE DIFFERENT AREAS OF THE NEIGHBORHOOD, YOU SHOULD SHAPE THE SECONDARY STREETS PRECISELY.</u></p>
        <p>The secondary streets have been located earlier. Their direction and approximate width are known. However, their final precise shaping and formation cannot take place together with the subdivision of the lots. At this time you will have to give to the secondary street its exact width; it can vary from 7 to 10m, so that it will provide for a two-way lane for cars and for sidewalks. The width of the secondary street will be a function of its length, and it does not have to remain the same for its full length. It can narrow down when approaching its end, or a turning point. However, the change in the width of the secondary street should not be arbitrary. It will have to produce a street that consists of one or two or three parts that are easy to drive along, pleasant to walk, and produce a coherent street.</p>
        <p>In some cases along a secondary street a small square, an intimate place might emerge. Its size and placement should be such that it does not compete with the main square of the neighborhood, but creates another small center in the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>All of these will have to take place together with the lot subdivision along them, so that public space and house will form together a coherent whole.</p>

        <p>After you have completed your work on the site of laying out the neighborhood, it is necessary to make a precise recording of all the stakes put on the site. On the basis of this survey, you will make the final drawing of the neighborhood. You may need to make some minor changes or adjustments, but do not alter the major structure of the neighborhood in its major aspects. That will spoil the relationship of the layout of the neighborhood with the reality of the actual site.</p>
        <p>In some cases it may be necessary to conduct the final steps of the layout process, which include the lot subdivision and location of smaller streets away from the site. However, in any case, all of the first six steps, which determine the overall structure of the neighborhood, will have to take place on the site.</p>

        <p><br>
        In accordance with the wishes expressed to us by ISA, we have defined a road pattern for the neighborhood which is reasonably economical in length, and therefore cost of services.</p>
        <p>Of course, the cost of services would be smaller if the lots were smaller in absolute area, or narrower in frontage. However, for the reasons discussed in section 4, we consider these alternatives unacceptable for cultural, climatic, and economic reasons. Above all, it is necessary to bear in mind that the economic reason may have dramatic impact on the success or failure of the new town. It is essential that lots be attractive to newcomers, since the economic life of the town depends absolutely on a steady influx of new inhabitants. This will happen only if special conditions exist which make Guasare a favorable choice, and this requires that lots in Guasare be more attractive. We therefore consider it essential that lots be large (about 470 m2 and close to square in shape.</p>
        <p>Under these conditions, the street network we have defined creates a minimum possible average length of services per lot: about 12m per lot.</p>
        <p>In order to save money and to reduce the interest cost of infrastructure, we propose the following four-step sequence for the provision of services:</p>
        <p>1. Provision of water and sewer and electricity in the main and secondary streets. This will be done immediately after the initial subdivision of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>2. Provision of water, sewer and electricity in tertiary streets. This will be done step-by-step, according to the development which proceeds in different local areas, and the rate at which that development proceeds.</p>
        <p>3. Paving of main and secondary streets, with provision of sidewalks where necessary.</p>
        <p>4. Paving of tertiary streets.</p>
