  <p><font size="4" color="#F3F5D9">Few modern offices have this quality. Typically, there is a more haphazard arrangement of available pieces of furniture, quickly installed. The process of work is not reflected in the layout of the office. It is not a truly comfortable place to work. It is not a deeply efficient place to work.</font></p>
