        <p><u>ASSUMPTIONS ABOUT THE PHYSICAL DESIGN OF HOUSES AND CONTROL OVER THE DESIGN</u></p>
        <p>1. We assume that almost all families will have control over the layout of their own houses, and will therefore have charge of the design.</p>
        <p>2. This process will be conducted within the framework of a set of rules which will be made available to every family. The family will use the rules to define the increment of construction they wish to build.</p>
        <p>3. Available financing will be contingent on the use of these rules by the family, and on the conformity of the resulting house to this system of rules.</p>
        <p>4. The rules will be consistent with all necessary aspects of Venezuelan climate and culture.</p>
        <p>5. The way the rules will work will allow incremental growth of all houses, so that even in cases where financing requires slow growth, one room at a time, nevertheless the system of rules will guarantee that the house forms a coherent whole.</p>
        <p>6. We assume that this layout process, and the use of the rules by the families, may require some small amount of assistance by the staff of the local builder's yard being operated under the control of Corpozulia.</p>
        <p>In order to stimulate the growth of houses, we propose that a few miners' houses be built, completely inside the neighborhood, at the beginning of the neighborhood's growth. This is consistent with the principle agreed on in September 1982, namely, that miners' housing which is built without participation of users, will to some extent be mixed in with the other housing of the neighborhood.</p>

        <p>1. Each house has a patio at its center. The patio is the heart of the house, with all the rooms surrounding it and opening into it.</p>

        <p>2. Every house has a main big garden, about two thirds the size of the lot. The garden has rectangular shape with many trees and plants.</p>
        <p>3. The main garden and the patio are lined up in the direction of the wind so that the wind blows from the garden into the patio.</p>
        <p>4. There is always an opening (kind of neck) in the volume of the house between the patio and the garden so that wind blows directly into the patio.</p>
        <p></p>

        </table>
        <p>5. The patio is surrounded, at least partly, by a wide, porch-like veranda, 2 to 3 m wide.</p>
        <p>6. In general, the house volume touches the street, if not all along its frontage, on its major part. This is especially important at the main and secondary streets, and on important street corners.</p>
        <p>7. There is occasionally a porch on the front of the house. It is a small uncovered paved area that creates an area of transition between the street and the house entrance.</p>
        <p>8. Each house has a formal sala for receiving guests. The sala is always located at the front of the house next to the main entrance.</p>
        <p>9. Each house has a comedor for family gatherings, eating, etc. The comedor is the largest room of the house, located somewhere at the back of the house in direct relationship with the patio.</p>
        <p>10. The kitchen of the house is one of the most private areas of the house, located at the back of the house, usually between the patio and the garden.</p>
        <p>11. Most of the houses have an enramada in the garden. The enramada is often connected or attached to the volume of the house that stands between the patio and the garden. The enramada helps to attribute wholeness in the formation of the garden.</p>

        <p>12. The house is composed of distinct volumes, two, three or more depending on the house.</p>
        <p>13. One of the volumes of the house has a slightly more obvious and more pronounced roof than the rest of the house. This is the part of the house that occupies the most important position. Usually it is the comedor.</p>

        <p>14. The main circulation in the house happens through the patio. The main entrance into the house leads from the street or porch into the patio, and from there circulation is distributed into the different rooms and areas of the house.</p>
        <p>15. The front door of the house is placed in such a way that passers-by can get a quick glimpse of the patio when the door is partly open.</p>
        <p>16. The house provides for a variety of spaces with respect to feeling: from the brightest and lightest areas in the garden to the cool and shadowy patio, to the dark and enclosed rooms. Also, from the most public areas of the house along the street, like the sala and the porch, to the most private rooms in the back of the house, between the patio and the garden, like the kitchen and the comedor.</p>
        <p>17. There is a garden wall that separates one garden from the other and the garden from the street. The most important part of the garden wall is that which defines the boundary between the street and the garden.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The following rules will be given to every family which buys land in Guasare. The planners and architects of CES and Proguasare will then help each family to use these rules to lay out a house for themselves, directly on their own lot, using stakes. Arrangements will be made for the house to be built according to the various financing packages, and construction procedures, described in chapter 3.</p>
        <p></p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td align="center"><u>THE LAYOUT OF YOUR HOUSE</u></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><u>FIRST STEP: SIZE OF THE HOUSE</u></p>
        <p>Before you start laying out your house on the ground you have to make a major decision concerning the size of the house. The size of the house you will lay out at this point is not determined by the available financing you have at your disposition. Since houses will grow incrementally in the following years, at this time you will lay out the house that suits your family needs and the house that you dream you will be able to complete in the following five years.</p>
        <p>Now that you know your lot and the approximate amount of square meters that you want to build, you can start to lay out your house on the site. This means that you are going to shape each room on the ground. After each step, place stakes in the ground according to the instructions. This will help you to really understand how the house is going to be, how long and wide it will be, and how big each room will be. Do not hesitate to move the stakes until you are completely satisfied with each step. Only when you are sure that you like the house, that it is exactly as you want it, go on to the next step.</p>
        <p><u>SECOND STEP: THE LIMITS OF THE HOUSE</u></p>
        <p>The limits of the area allocated for the house volume have already been defined as part of the lot subdivision process, and it has been incorporated into the legal specifications that define the boundaries of each lot. (See Steps lO.c and 10.d of the subdivision rules.)</p>
        <p>At this point you will place the stakes in the corners of the rectangular area allocated for the building of the house according to the specifications of the legal document of your lot that you have received from Corpozulia. The size of the house area, that includes both house and patio, will vary between 10 x 10 m and 12 x 15 m.</p>
        <p>In cases where the area specified as house area in the legal document is smaller or bigger than the size of the house you want to lay out, then you may adjust the house area. You will do so only by moving the stakes that define the boundary between your house and the garden. You are not allowed to move any of the other stakes from the positions as specified in the legal document.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>THIRD STEP: LAYOUT OF THE PATIO</u></p>
        <p>1. The patio is an open space, not covered, located in the center of the house. It has a rectangular shape.</p>
        <p>2. Its size varies from 18 m2 to 23 m2.</p>
        <p>3. Once you have chosen the size, shape the patio on the ground by putting one stake on each corner of the patio and extending a thick rope along each side. This will help you to understand how big the patio is, and to shape it as you want it. Later, when the rooms of the house are laid out, you may have to readjust this first layout.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>FOURTH STEP: LAYOUT OF THE WINGS</u></p>
        <p>1. In laying out the patio, you have created four wings. All the rooms of the house will be built in these wings. Probably you will have to readjust these wings as you lay out the rooms.</p>
        <p>2. The width of the wings varies from 2.6m to 4m.</p>
        <p>3. One of these four wings should be wider than the others. This is the one where the biggest room of the house, the comedor, is located. This wing should have a good orientation, and face the breeze with a nice view into the patio or into the garden.</p>
        <p></p>

        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>FIFTH STEP: LAYOUT OF THE OPENING</u></p>
        <p>1. One side of the patio opens directly into the garden.</p>
        <p>2. This opening is a transition space which connects the patio and the garden, and it will permit the wind to blow from the garden to the patio. It is located on the wing which is between the patio and the garden.</p>
        <p>3. This opening can be covered or not (in most cases it is covered); it can be just a passage from the patio to the garden -- 2m wide is the minimum, or can be a more spacious area, as wide as the patio.</p>
        <p>4. When the house is small, the opening can be on two sides. In this case, one of the openings is always covered to help to shape the patio.</p>

        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>SIXTH STEP: LAYOUT OF THE ENTRANCE</u></p>
        <p>1. The entrance room is always located on the main street.</p>
        <p>2. The entrance room leads directly into the patio.</p>
        <p>3. The entrance door may be recessed from the front wall in order to provide a transition, a porch, between the street and the entrance room.</p>
        <p>4. The back door between the entrance room and the patio can be omitted so that the entrance room can take the form of a deep and small covered porch.</p>
        <p>5. In many cases, provide a door or a simple opening which leads directly from the entrance room to the sala.</p>
        <p>6. The width of the entrance room varies from 1.5m to 3m. Its length is given by the width of the wing.</p>

        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>SEVENTH STEP: LAYOUT OF THE SALA</u></p>
        <p>1. The sala, the most public room of the house, is always on the street, next to the entrance.</p>
        <p>2. The sala is located on one of the two corners of the built area, which faces the street. When the house faces a square or a widening along the street, the sala faces this widening.</p>
        <p>3. Its size varies from 9 m2 to 13 m2.</p>
        <p>4. Shape the sala on the ground; put in the stakes and the rope. Walk in this room until you become familiar with it, and don't hesitate to move the stakes until the sala is as you want it, until you feel comfortable in it.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>EIGHTH STEP: LAYOUT OF THE COMEDOR</u></p>
        <p>1. The comedor is the room where the family get together. It is the biggest room of the house.</p>
        <p>2. The comedor should be located on the widest wing of the house. In most cases it is pleasanter to have the comedor located either between the garden and the patio, or totally in the patio.</p>
        <p>3. The comedor should have windows from two sides in order to provide a nice light and to allow cross ventilation.</p>
        <p>4. Its size varies from 13m2 to 21m2.</p>
        <p>5. Once you find the best spot to locate the comedor, place the stakes. Try to imagine how the room is going to be, walk through it, go back and forth from the comedor to the patio, move the stakes until you are satisfied.</p>

        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>NINTH STEP: LAYOUT OF THE KITCHEN</u></p>
        <p>1. The kitchen is one of the most private rooms of the house.</p>
        <p>2. Either the kitchen is next to the comedor, or it is linked to the comedor by a veranda.</p>
        <p>3. The kitchen should open onto the patio.</p>
        <p>4. Its size varies from 9m2 to 13m2.</p>
        <p></p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>TENTH STEP: LAYOUT OF THE VERANDAS</u></p>
        <p>1. The verandas are covered open spaces where you can sit, have a drink, and they are also circulation spaces; the rooms open into them.</p>
        <p>2. One of the verandas is very often located on the opening between the patio and the garden.</p>
        <p>3. You can have a small veranda, 2m wide minimum, a place in the patio where it will be pleasant to sit protected from the sun. And you can have a more spacious veranda, to cook outside, for example. In this case the veranda is deeper than 3m.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td align="center"><img src="house13.gif" width="450"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>ELEVENTH STEP: REFINEMENT OF THE PATIO</u></p>
        <p>1. Now that you know where the main rooms and veranda are, you can shape the patio more precisely.</p>
        <p>2. Some minor changes may be required by the layout of the other rooms. If so, move some stakes until everything fits together.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td align="center"><img src="house14.gif" width="450"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><br>
        <u>TWELVTH STEP: LAYOUT OF THE BEDROOMS AND BATHROOM</u></p>
        <p>1. In the wing or part of wing which is not yet laid out, you have to locate the bedrooms and bathroom.</p>
        <p>2. Bedrooms: The bedrooms can open directly into the patio, or you can have a small transition space which will generally serve two bedrooms. This small corridor is about 1 m wide and 2 m to 2.50 m long. It does not have a front door to let in light and breeze. The size of the bedrooms varies from 8 m2 to 13 m2.</p>
        <p>3. Bathroom: The bathroom is located next to the bedroom or between two bedrooms. The bathroom can open either into the patio or into the corridor. Its size is about 4 m2.</p>
        <p></p>
        <table align="center">
          <tr>
            <td align="center"><img src="house15.gif" width="450"></td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p><br>
        Now that all the rooms and open space are defined, go again into each room, try to experience the space. Walk from the entrance to the comedor, spend some time in the veranda, go into the kitchen, and so on. Move the stakes if necessary; see if every room corresponds to your wishes. You might have to make some improvements; for example, you might have to change slightly the length of a room until everything seems perfectly right. Be careful to keep the size of the house within the limit of square meters decided upon at the beginning.</p>
        <p>On the following two pages we show the sequence of steps of house layout for two more houses so as to make clear the variation of house layout that can be generated through the rules.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>The process of layout we have defined will generate a wide variety of houses in the neighborhood. We hope that among these houses there will be a strong feeling that each family has put itself into the house, that it has shaped and embellished it with care and great concern.</p>
        <p>The variety among the houses is not something random that comes out of personal ideas and whims; it is more a set of variations on a main theme. There is a basic and profound similarity in all the houses. They have the same structure, the same organization, the same patterns incorporated into them, since each one of them responds to the same basic climatic and cultural considerations.</p>
        <p>The variation from house to house is caused by three main factors:</p>
        <p>1. The relationship between street-patio-garden. The relationship of these three elements differs in its specific details from house to house, even though the principle is always the same.</p>
        <p>2. The financial situation of the family. As we shall see in chapter 3, financing programs will be created to assist the building of houses. Depending on the financing program that is available for the family, the family may be able to build a complete house from the beginning or follow the incremental construction of the house; the house will have different size and different rooms according to the means available.</p>
        <p>3. The different use of the patterns and rules for the layout of the house by different families. Each family, by applying these rules and patterns to its own particular case, will attribute a different configuration to them with reference to its needs and aspirations.</p>
        <p></p>

          </tr>
        </table><br>
        It is very important to realize that this variety among the houses does not arise because we wish to make things different. It is a variety that emanates from the needs of the site and from the needs of each individual family, but at the same time respects the coherency and harmony of the neighborhood.
        <p>The rules of the house layout process allow for different house sizes and different distributions of the total square meters of the house in its rooms. The following plans are an example of different house sizes:</p>

        <p>It is clear from everything which has been said so far that our intention in this project is to provide a form of housing which is deeply controlled by the users and inhabitants of the houses, and to avoid as thoroughly as possible the type of modern construction in which the individuality and uniqueness of different families are not respected. However, at the same time, it is necessary to pay attention to certain relities. In the case of Guasare new town, the town is, in essence, being built by the corporation of Carbozulia to house their mine workers. In discussion with the top managers of Carbozulia, we have found out that in very many cases, the miners will be hired from a long distance, and that they will agree to work or not according to the quality of housing which is made available to them</p>
        <p>It is therefore necessary, from the point of view of Carbozulia, to build considerable numbers of mine-workers' houses in which the family cannot play a role in the design of the houses because the houses must be designed and built before the miners appear in Guasare.</p>
        <p>Of course, the miners' housing, which lines the collector roads of the new town, will fulfill this requirement. However, since it is clear that many miners may wish to live inside the neighborhoods, not outside them, we have also agreed to build some percentage of miners' houses inside the neighborhoods mixed in with the other houses created by the neighborhood process.</p>
        <p>In these cases, since the family cannot be identified ahead of time, we propose to use a few fixed designs which are capable of fitting various conditions of street and topographic orientation. These houses will be built right away, as soon as the neighborhood infrastructue is complete, and they will then form a kind of fixed core around which the other houses of the neighborhood will slowly grow.</p>

        <p>We have made the assumption that only about 25 per cent of the houses in each neighborhood will be built from the beginning as complete houses. These houses will belong to miners' families and to certain other families with monthly income more than Bs.3000. This assumption is based on Echenique's analysis of income distribution in the population of Guasare.</p>
        <p>The remaining 75 per cent of the houses in each neighborhood will grow incrementally because of the limited amount of money available to each family for house construction. These 75 per cent of the houses will belong mainly to families with less than Bs.3000 monthly income.</p>
        <p>The rate of the incremental growth of the house will depend on the financial situation of each family. However, the financing programs proposed in chapter 3 provide the possibility for each family to build the first increment of the house of about 20 x 30 m2 through a subsidy from Corpozulia as soon as arrangements about land ownership have been completed, and a second increment varying between 15 x 35 m2 through a financing program of loans from INAVI or through credit for materials from Corpozulia. Through these programs, families will have the opportunity to build an initial house of about 35 to 65 m2 within one or two years. The growth of the houses beyond this point will depend mostly on the savings of each family and on the money available yearly from each one of them for house construction. It seems that probably the overall pace of growth of the houses in the neighborhood will slow down after the completion of the first two increments.</p>
        <p>Houses which will be built incrementally will have the same structure and the same layout principles as houses built complete from the beginning. The structure of the house that we have proposed, beyond being adapted to the cultural and climatic needs of this Venezuelan area, gives the possibility of its incremental construction while keeping its structure apparent and intact at each step. The increments of construction for each house will have to be chosen in such a way as not to violate the structure of the house but to enhance it at each step of the construction.</p>
        <p>The families who will intend to build their house incrementally won't have to go through a detailed layout of the whole house in its complete form. Before they start the construction of the first increment they will have to accomplish the following things on the site:</p>
        <p>1. Layout and precise staking of the area of the lot allotted to the house, already indicated at the time of subdivision.</p>
        <p>2. Layout and staking of the patio at the center of the house.</p>
        <p>3. Layout of the wings that surround the patio where the rooms of the house will be built.</p>
        <p>4. The area of the opening in the wings that will connect the patio with the garden.</p>
        <p>5. The approximate location of the entrance to the house. While these decisions are being made, the family should bear in mind the size of the house that they need when completed.</p>

          </tr>
        </table>Before each increment of construction starts, a precise layout of the increment must take place on the site, according to the patterns and organization of the Guasare house described in sections 2 and 3 of this chapter.
        <p>The size of the increments of construction will vary in size depending on the available financing and on the needs of the family. The location of the increment in the buildable area of the house is very important, since each increment will have to contribute the most to the formation of the patio, and some of them to the formation of the street.</p>
        <p>The first increment of the house, which in most cases will include two rooms and some covered open space, will have to contribute to the formation of the street. At least part of this first increment of construction will have to be placed on the wing of the house between the patio and the street. Beyond this, the first increment will have to start the formation of the patio.</p>
        <p>With the second increment of the house, the patio will have to be pinned down and defined to a considerable degree, though not fully developed and completed. At this stage the use of covered open spaces will strongly help the formation of the patio.</p>
        <p>The following examples show the sequence of construction increments for different houses of different sizes. The contribution of each construction increment to the whole house is best shown in these examples:</p>
