          <h6><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">Let us consider the subtle nature of placing windows in a building. What are the issues that govern this placement?</span></h6>
          <ul>
            <li><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">We want to put the windows in positions which give onto beautiful views -- that means distant views, and near views, a favorite bush, a tree, a place flowers bloom, a place where the sun shines and reflects into the room.</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">We want to put the windows in such a way that sunshine comes into the room (in a moderate climate).</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">We want to place the windows so that the light is good -- not just enough of it, but beautifully placed so that the room comes to life because of the light in the room.</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">We want to place the windows so that the result of the placement, creates centers which are well-placed in the sense that they generate warm, comfortable human space which is pleasant to inhabit.</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">We want to preserve unbroken wall surface in the room, and not have too many holes.</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">We want to take as given, that windows can only be in exterior walls, obviously, and make the most of the available exterior walls.</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">We also want the windows, as rectangles, to be pleasant and beautiful to look at, look through -- this concerns their shape and size: grouping, and articulation.</span></li>
            <li><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">And we must be concerned about the effect of these windows, with those in other rooms, on the overall character of the building in which they are placed, when seen in context with all the other windows, as a pattern of windows from the outside.</span></li>
          </ul><span style="color:000000;background-color:eeeeee">We must juggle these factors, to make a beautiful room. In order to juggle them, we need information about these realities. Much of it can be felt, judged, in the real situation. It could, in principle, be matched on a game, on a computer, provide that each of these issues was present, with some reality, to allow us to judge each one, and make a whole, from the combination of these effects, which gets the right windows, for THAT room, in THAT context.</span> <a name="why" id="why"></a>
          <p></p>
          <h3><b><span style="color:ffffff;background-color:55bbff">It is quite hard juggling these factors -- which will often be contradictory and hard to resolve in particular cases. In order to make this feasible, and natural, we will set up a decision sequence, that allows a person to get a near-optimal solution, for a particular cases, in a very straightforward series of steps. That is the essence of a sequence -- that it allows a person to solve this maze of conflicting requirements, easily and quickly.</span></b></h3>
