          <h3><font color="brown"><u>FROM CONFESSION TO DEEP WONDER</u></font></h3>

          <h4><font color="brown">by Jenny Quillien</font></h4>

          It was supposed to be a day off in Istanbul after a conference. Of course I knew about the carpet collection that Chris had dedicated so much time and attention to over the years. I had really enjoyed the book, <u>The Foreshadowing of 21st Century Art</u> that he had written. The carpets had taught him so much about the impact of the motivation of the maker, and so much about colors and shapes. So no suprise, that on a day off in Istanbul we were headed to the museums to see carpets.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Truthfully, if you want the real <i><b>confession</b></i> I had always found the rugs interesting but - you know - it was mild. If anyone had asked my personal preference, between a 14th Sufi rug and a Matisse -- well, give me the Matisse any day.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">And then <i>Gasp!</i> I stroll into the display room at the Turk ve Islam museum and get hit between the eyes. A very large white carpet with dark reddish circles is pulsating, vibrating, alive on the wall, and looking right me.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown"><br>
          <br>
          <img src="seljuk-1.jpg" width="500"></font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">I quickly learned from Chris that it was a well known carpet from the 13th century made not far from Konya. Chris had seen it in pictures but never in the flesh, so to speak. Probably the greatest of great carpets. This carpet has since taken up much thought and discussion.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Why was this carpet so utterly compelling? Why was it so powerful? The photos do not do it justice, but anyone interested in the material on this website will be interested in this carpet.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">The pattern seems, at first, regular and extremely simple. It is, after all, simply a repeating red octagon, on an off-white field. When one examines the carpet, one cannot help noticing the extraordinary variation which occurs. The red octagons vary in size, in the angle of the diagonal edges, in the squashedness, and in their spacing. Yet the spacing, appears regular, more or less, anyway.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">What is the origin of the irregularity? Is merely an artefact of inaccurate production, or is it something more interesting?<br>
          <br>
          <img src="seljuk-2.jpg" width="500"><br>
          <i>At this scale we begin to notice variation, but it is not altogether pronounced</i></font></p>
          <p><font color="brown"><img src="seljuk-3.jpg" width="500"></font></p>
          <p><font color="brown"><img src="seljuk-4.jpg" width="500"><br>
          <i>When we look at the octagons in detail, we first see the truly extraordinary level of variation from octagon to octagon. This photograph is not distorted by perspective, or by shrinking of the carpet: this is how the octagons were DRAWN originally, and how they appear, without distortion.</i></font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">There are of course various possible explanations for the enormous variation. The carpet has shrunk or been stretched, during its 700 years of life. The weaver did not know how to make the octagons more accurate, because her available methods were &quot;primitive.&quot; The distortions are simply mistakes. It was intended to be regular, but came out irregular because the methods were not accurate enough to make them regular.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">No doubt whatever, that the variation we see was introduced for one reason or another, by the weaver.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">The hypothesis is that the white background has a multiplicity of octagons and rectangles and that these shapes or &quot;centers&quot; although unmarked are the essence of the design. The requirement to respect this geometry forces an irregularity of the red octagons. It would take a great deal of research to work out exactly how this carpet does what it does. Remember that a knot is 1/8 of an inch by 1/8 of an inch and each one is knoted separately. This patterns of what appears to be extreme simplicity is, in fact, one of great complexity.</font></p>

          <p><font color="brown">PS. If you are ever in Istanbul go to the Turk ve Islam Museum and see for yourself. You, too, will experience deep wonder.</font></p>
