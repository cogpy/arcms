          <li>The smallest, focused center, is more elaborate, stands alone, offers opportunity for contemplation and quiet. But it is not the smallest, or the most focused place.</li>
          <li>Standing apart, in contrast to the smallest center, there is an even smaller center. This gives the whole its zest.</li>
