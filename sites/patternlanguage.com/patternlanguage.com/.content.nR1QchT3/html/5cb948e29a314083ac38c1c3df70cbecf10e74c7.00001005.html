  <h1>CHAPTER 3<br>
  ORDINANCE STANDARDS</h1>
  <h2 class="lines">3.1<br>
  INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p>The ordinance has two parts.</p>
  <p></p></a><a href="#3_2">Section 3.2</a> contains density standards and open space standards. It is fundamental to these standards that the density permitted on any given lot, is a function of lot size, parking type, parking ratio, driveway type, and densities on adjacent lots. Open space requirements are also expressed as a function of lot size. The tables which show density and open space standards, express these interactions.
  <p><a href="#3_3">Section 3.3</a> contains design standards for all other aspects of the development, including setbacks, window requirements, height requirements, and other detailed provisions. The standards are organised with the same numbering system as the application forms, so that applicants will easily understand which standards apply to the various sections of the application form. <a name="3_2" id="3_2">
  <h2 class="lines">3.2<br>
  STANDARDS FOR DENSITY AND OPEN SPACE</h2>
  <p>The following charts show the allowable relationships between density, open space and parking for RM-16, RM-32 AND RM-48 zones.</p>
  <p class="center">NOTES</p>
  <p>1. All densities are expressed in terms of allowed construction volume, expressed in square feet of allowed construction.</p>
  <p>Careful analysis of the Pasadena fabric has convinced us that it is more important to regulate the total built volume on a given site, than the number of households. For this reason densities are expressed as permitted square feet of construction. The variable A represents the square foot of the lot, thus getting construction volume as a function of lot area.</p>
  <p>2. All densities are context-sensitive.</p>
  <p>It is necessary to protect existing neighborhoods, so that new construction densities cannot "swamp" the feeling or character of an existing neighborhood. The protection appears in the form of a context multiplier C. When surrounding densities are low, C is low, and the permitted density, is therefore constrained to respect the prevailing density.</p>
  <p>3. Density varies with lot dimension.</p>
  <p>Our studies show clearly that larger lots can and should bear a higher density than smaller lots. We show different permitted densities as a function of lot width, under three categories: Width less than 50' and less than 9,900 sf lot area, widths between 51' and 80', and widths greater than 80'.</p>
  <p>4. Density varies with parking ratio.</p>
  <p>Our studies show clearly that high parking ratios have a damaging effects on neighborhoods, unless they are offset by lower densities. The prevailing assumption of this ordinance is that parking ratios are to be set at 1.5:1. Any project wishing to provide a 2:1 parking ratio, has a reduced density, expressed in the form of a density penalty.</p>
  <p>5. Density varies with driveway type.</p>
  <p>Our studies have shown that proliferation of driveways also has a damaging effect on the environment, unless offset by lower densities. This ordinance encourages developers to seek shared-driveway easements with their neighbors. Any developer able to share a driveway with an adjacent lot will a density bonus.</p>
  <p>6. Density varies with parking type.</p>
  <p>In order to care for the environment, permitted densities must vary with parking type. The density charts show different densities for three cases: surface parking, half depressed parking, and full underground parking with mechanical ventilation.</p>
  <p>7. Substantial size of open apace plays an essential role.</p>
  <p>Size of required main gardens and subsidiary gardens, are given for the different lot type. These restrictions do not directly affect allowable density, but have an impact on possible configurations, as shown in the examples which follow.</p>
  <p>8. Real gardens over earth must be provided.</p>
  <p>In those cases where full underground garages are provided, the main garden must be built over real soil, not over a podium on the garage. This also affects possible configurations as shown in the pages which follow.</p>

  <h4>1.1. MAP OF CONTEXT AND SURROUNDINGS.</h4>
  <p>No guidelines and design standards.</p>
  <h4>1.2. POSITION OF MAIN GARDEN.</h4>
  <p>The main garden must contribute to the positive qualities of the existing place. Its placement is the most important thing that can help to do this. Accordingly, the judgement about the proposed position of the main garden is very important.</p>
  <p>There are numerous ways according to which the main garden can do this. For example:</p>
  <p>a. If there is an existing large garden on the adjacent lot, the main garden may be placed so that these two spaces work together to form one large garden, or so that there is a wide connection between the two spaces.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p1.gif" width="502" height="160"></p>
  <p>b. If there is beautiful front garden in the street, or the feeling of a broad lawn with the frontage of the buildings at least 30' to to 35' back from the sidewalk, the proposed main garden may be connected with existing front garden on at least one side, so as to form a "long" front garden along the street.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p2.gif" width="228" height="126"></p>
  <p>c. If there is a need for a deep open space on the street, part of proposed building frontage should be located at least 75' back from the sidewalk, so as to form a "deep" garden on the street. In this case, the front garden must be enclosed by existing buildings of adjacent lots on at least one side.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p3.gif" width="155" height="161"></p>
  <p>d. If there is a need for spacious internal courtyard on the block, proposed main garden should be an internal courtyard entirely contained within the lot. This is mainly possible on a lot wider than 80', and is difficult on a narrower lot.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p4.gif" width="190" height="170"></p>
  <p>e. If there is a beautiful tree or stand of trees, the main garden may be placed so that the trees form a focal point of the main garden.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p5.gif" width="123" height="120"></p>
  <p>f. If there is an apartment building on an adjacent lot, with entrances facing the proposed building, the main garden may be placed so that those entrances are on the edge of a large shared space which includes the main garden.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p6.gif" width="403" height="168"></p>
  <p>g. If there is a single family house next door, the main garden may be placed so that there is e large space next to the house, for light and view.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p7.gif" width="104" height="140"></p>
  <p class="center">-o0o-</p>
  <p>Of course, the way in which the main garden can best improve the positive qualities of the existing place depends on the specific site itself, and there may be some other important feature, not listed above, which could be helped by the placement of the main garden.</p>
  <p>Or, it may be that the site has more than one important, positive features--for example, a stand of trees on one side and the entrances to an adjacent apartment building on the other side. In such a case it is of course preferable that the main garden take account of both. But, if this is not possible, then the main garden must respond to at least one of these positive features.</p>

  <p>If the main garden is working together with a garden on a adjacent lot, then the following rule must be observed, in addition to the rectangle rule within the main garden of the proposed building itself, as specified on paragraph 2.2-A of this section of the ordinance.</p>
  <p>It must be possible to draw a rectangle [A+B) which includes both:</p>
  <p>i. A rectangle within the main garden [B] that is at least 65;G the area of the main garden (this is not necessarily the same rectangle used to check the shape of the main garden itself, as specified in Paragraph 2.2a of this Ordinance; and</p>
  <p>ii. An area in the garden of the adjacent lot (AI that is at least 800 sf in area, and which has a minimum dimension of 20 feet.</p>

  <h5>A. Maximum width of building volume.</h5>
  <p>Maximum width of building volume is 35 ft.</p>
  <h5>A.#1 Enclosure of main garden.</h5>
  <p>Open space needs life. This life comes from the fact that the space borrows life from the buildings which surround it. The rectangle of open space must be bounded by buildings, and by small walls, hedges, and trees.</p>
  <p>The main garden, except when it is a front lawn, must be bounded along 607. of its perimeter with building.</p>
  <p>In addition to this, low walls, hedges, trees, trellises..., have to contribute an addition 15'/. enclosure of its perimeter.</p>
  <p>We define bounded as follows: Any point along the perimeter line of the rectangle is said to be bounded if a line perpendicular to the perimeter line and passing through the point intersects either: i. a piece of the building outside the rectangle without intersecting another line of the rectangle. ii. a piece of a neighboring building, within 15' of the property line, without intersecting another line of the rectangle.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p13.gif" width="338" height="168"></p>
  <h5>B. Visibility of interior garden from street.</h5>
  <p>All interior gardens and courtyards should be experienced from the street, and be visible from it.</p>
  <p>Specifically, a main interior garden must be visible from the street. This requirement may be satisfied by means of a covered passage between an interior garden and the street, that is at least 8' wide, or by a wider opening between the front buildings of the proposed project.</p>
  <h5>C. Front setbacks.</h5>
  <p>Definition:<br>
  <u>Alignment of building fronts:</u><br>
  Alignment is defined according to the following diagram:</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p14.gif" width="350" height="204"></p>
  <p>Each project must conform to at least one of the following three cases:</p>
  <p>i. At least 60% of the facade must line up with the front facade of at least one adjacent building. (Required in RM-16).</p>

  <p>iii. ALLOWED ONLY IN RM-32 AND RM-48.</p>
  <p>A width of at least 20' of one (1) storey volume may project in front of adjacent building that is closer to the street, subject to the following limitations:</p>
  <p>-- In no case may a building volume come closer than 10 ft. from the property line.</p>
  <p>-- No more that 40' of such volumes per 400' of street, measured 200' on each side of centerline of proposed projecting volume are allowed.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p17.gif" width="348" height="402"></p>
  <p>Exception: ALLOWED IN ALL DENSITY ZONES.</p>
  <p>Bay windows, covered porches, etc...... ..... may project in front of context setbacks without being subject to the limitations of paragraph 2.3c, point (iii), if the area of projecting volumes is less than 20 sf.</p>
  <h5>D. Width of building volume along the street.</h5>
  <p>i. On a lot which is 80' wide or less, the length of the building volume along the street must-be at least 40% the width of the lot.</p>
  <p>In addition, at least 70% of the width of the lot must be occupied by the front wall of the building volume and low wall, trellis, hedges, etc.</p>
  <p class="center"><img src="3_3_p18.gif" width="369" height="296"></p>
  <p>ii. On a lot which is more than 80' wide, the length of the building volume must be at least 50% the width of the lot.</p>

  <h5>F.#1 Length of wall at minimum separation, opposite windows in adjacent buildings.</h5>
  <p>The required length of wall of proposed building, located at minimum separation, opposite a window of adjacent building, is determined on the following way:</p>
  <p>Construct, in plan, two 45º angles, one at each side of the window of adjacent building, whose light is to be respected. Extend a line from each of those angles, at 450, until they meet the wall of the proposed building, located at minimum separation. The two points of intersection mark the end points of the minimum acceptable length of wall.</p>
