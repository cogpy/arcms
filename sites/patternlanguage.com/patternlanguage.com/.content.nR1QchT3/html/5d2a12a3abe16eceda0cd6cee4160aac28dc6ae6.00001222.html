                Never heard of the guy you refer to building his house of beach rocks. I'll have to keep an eye out for pictures of his work. I won't have to lug the rocks far.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">You said you have no carpentry skills. I'm wondering if you read the section of the patterns that show how to construct thick walls using cement and forms. It doesn't take much skill, just an attitude to do it. Ken Kern wrote a book about building your own house and another about making a masonry stove. In the stove book he describes two middle age women without construction experience who set about to build a cement house and did so.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I bet you sew. That qualifies as at least some experience in my book. And I bet you cook. You can follow a plan, use tools to complete the task, measure, cut, and divide materials, and appraise quality throughout the task. Don't let a cultural bias toward women building hold you back.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">One of the patterns, 104 Site Repair ends with comment:<br>
                "Above all, leave the trees intact and build around them with great care...."</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I'm going to the property again at the end of this week. I hope to connect with an engineer that lives close by to evaluate the foundation of the house that burned down. I am thinking about building a platform over the pit and putting 3 small structures connected by a cascade of roofs on top of the platform.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">You know, about all that stone and stonework on your basement/garage there, have you ever heard of the poet Robinson Jeffers? I read that he built his own entire house, tower and all, of stones he personally lugged up from the beach and fixed in place, over several years.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">A couple new real estate things opened up around here, both with location problems. One, decent, pleasant, affordable across the busy street from Citgo; the other -- stunningly perfect: built up over the years into a hill, interesting windows, a casual plaza-like parking/walking area, a former inground pool full of frogs, a pottery studio, several outbuildings, a meadow! Right next door to some former greenhouses full of trash and the trash-filled parking lot of an oil delivery company. I'd never be able to let the kids out. Far from work & school & expensive, too.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So, we recently revisited the idea of renting and building, but I'm a coward. And, although I know someone is going to do it anyway, I hate to be the guy responsible for tearing up the woods.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I, for my part, know absolutely nothing about building. I am tentatively taking a first few steps into carpentry, and I know some practical things from general homeowner experience, but I couldn't begin to figure how the cellar holds up the house holds up the upstairs holds up the roof. A great mystery.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hunting for real estate can be a pain. So much of what appeals doesn't show on the listing data. (I chuckle trying to imagine some of the patterns being printed on the listing, like: positive outdoor space; half hidden garden; cascade of roofs.) Then you have to ponder the lending rate. Will it rise tomorrow? Is it better to jump on something with potential, or wait for something better??</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My purchase was almost accidental. My mother has owned a 10 acre property near Westcliffe CO for 30 years. We had tried to find it 3 times through the years and failed. I was never excited because I thought it was just scrub and sage and boring. We went on a Friday 2 years ago and visited the tax assessor and he copied a map highlighting the path. It is a beautiful property. Lots of pinon pine, a huge red cliff mountain to the west, and no neighbors visible from the land. I was excited and my mother said I could have it to build on. The next day she said I would have to share it with my sisters. I've always wanted to build a house but could not imagine how such a project could be shared. So I thought the best thing to do would be to buy my sisters out. I started looking on the internet for comparable properties in the immediate area. Thats how I found the property I ended up buying. It had a house that burned down, a good garage (24x36), well, septic, electric, telephone and a driveway. Electricity was more than a mile away on my mother's land. Telephone is up to her property line, but everything else would cost. I figured the price I paid was less than the cost of the same improvements on my mother's land.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have spent the 18 months since I purchased the land just cleaning up. I bought a small tractor and have moved all the debris out of the old basement. I did add some radiant foil insulation in the garage because I have been "camping" in there when I am on the property.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Because I am obsessed with building and feel like I may never finish at this rate, I am closing my business in Denver, selling my house, and moving up to the mountain. I am in a hurry because I want to get it on the market before the interest rate shoots up.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am an eclectic reader. I have read a few books about bees and making mead, and a chess book, but most of my reading has been related to building. In addition to the pattern language, I have read a couple books about solar designs, ferrocement water tanks, stonework (lots of stone on my property), and thinshell concrete habitats. I was fortunate to meet George Nez last year and helped him build a demonstration thin shell concrete roof for the University of Colorado. I struck up a friendship with him and have done more of these roofs including a demonstration on my own in Oregon this year.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am pleased that we have started a dialog here. I hope it encourages others to join in. I had hoped a practitioner would moderate and guide the discussion. Nevertheless, just the process of putting thoughts down in writing and getting feedback will be very beneficial. I hope it is for you as well.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Well, we are still shopping. Have not yet committed to the ranch.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In New Haven County, we live in an over-developed hodge-podge of wall-to-wall neighborhoods, some charming from the 1900's, some sprawling from the 50's-70'5, some truly obnoxious from the McMansion vinyl 90's.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The only land available for development is scary (former landfill, high-crime neighborhood) or anti-social (clearing the few remaining woods to build in a McMansion subdivision). Ok, so you treat your lot with respect, but you have to look out the window at the neighbor's vinyl bonus room. Here, at least, re-using basically good housing is both a moral and an aesthetic decision.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I find the patterns really, really compelling. Any existing house might already have some small percentage of them going for it. Then, you remodel to get the ones easily added: porches, blurry boundaries with landscaping, farmhouse kitchen, filtered light, even I'm thinking, old folks' cottage.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">And, you have to live with what you can't get: light on two sides, for example -- a killer!</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The questions are, what to live with, and how expensive it is to get the rest.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Must get kids to bed, but thanks for writing. I love this stuff and want to discuss it broadly.</font></p>

                My thought about using patterns to remodel is that it may take longer than building, or the temptation to dive in could undermine the larger perspective.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">For example, the kitchen on the 1 acre property is in great need of an update and would also be the most expensive room to update. While this may seem the most urgent, you may later decide it should be in another place.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">One of the problems with some of the old ranches is the house is usually just a rectangle. Floor plans weren't made considering any of the "patterns." This could take some thought to overcome.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I live in a ranch style now, and have spent 14 years working on it. Even though I hadn't yet read the patterns, I did several things right. I didn't/couldn't change room arrangements and that would be the worst part about this home.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">On one hand it seems like you favor the acre, in another it sounds like someone should tell you to keep shopping.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Thanks, Gary. Yes, the colonial is two stories, and brick, and very tight on its lot. Worse, it's at the very top of the ol' budget.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The house on a street I called "tony," meaning "too wealthy and aware of its wealth for us," is nifty. It's got non-standard windows, a strange floorplan, a back patio surrounded by windows from some of the interior rooms; an attic finished into two more bedrooms gives you "cascade of roofs" and "couple's realm." It really WAS designed by its "users." They just kept adding on as their family grew. But, it needs expensive unromantic work: creepy wet cellar, windows & doors don't open, new furnace, paint, kitchen, probably roof. It is also priced as if the work were already done.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The brick ranch on an acre is the cheapest choice, and its mechanicals are sound. It is not cute, not warm. It has dreadful wall-to-wall everywhere and loud wallpaper, a sad 1960's kitchen with fake-wood formica cabinets. But, that kind of work can be fun. The house is rather poorly located: it has no wild places nearby, no community centers nearby (libraries, parks, etc.), and very little neighborhood. It's alone on top of a hill, on a through street with no sidewalks, but it backs up on a closed-loop neighborhood, where I hope, there are children, old people etc. We have three children, and we're used to sidewalks, passers-by, street life.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I don't know. Is a brick house hard to modify? Can't move doors, change windows? Start with an ugly ranch in an empty football field, end with an ugly ranch with a few charming features in a half-landscaped-because-we-ran-out-of-money football field?</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi Kathy and Luca.<br>
                Sorry to delay so long in response.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In the absense of a practitioner/moderator for this chat room, I'd like to suggest we just continue to discuss issues with our specific situations and hold out hope that a knowledgeable person will tune in.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Kathy, you mentioned an idea of a large barn in the oak trees. Is it to be a barn or a barn-like house? Will this be a second house, or a future permanent residence?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">It seems the distance between NY and TX adds challenge to your project. I believe many techniques for handling the TX climate have been erased from common building practice. I know of a person in that area that has just completed or is near completion on a cinder block home in the old Mission style. He has a photo diary online if you're interested.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have worked on the problem posed in my first post. I stayed several days on my property with the patterns close at hand. I reviewed many patterns.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In pattern 110-Main Entrance, it says "Place the main entrance of the building at a point where it can be seen immediately from the main avenues of approach and give it bold, visible shape which stands out in front of the building."</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Since my driveway wraps around the building site, it is possible to approach the house from either East or North. I must make the main entrance visible from both approaches. The North approach will provide a good guest parking area, a close-to-the-building parking spot for me and be closest to the main entry on the NE corner. The Eastern approach suggests a nice stairway from the lower level to the NE corner. I think this will be the best location for the entry.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Now I have another problem to pose:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">What should I do with the existing basement?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Here's some background detail;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The fire left a 27'x36' cinder block basement with an East facing walkout on the same level as the garage 100' away.<br>
                At least the top 3 courses of cinderblock are fire damaged.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The South edge of the basement is only 2'from the well head and only 6-8' from the electrical service pole on the SW corner. The exit to the septic system is in SW corner of the basement.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">If I utilize the existing foundation, I may need to replace all of the cinder block.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Using the existing footprint, I cannot build an overhang on the South side of the house because well problems would require pump truck access.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The foundation is dug into rock - not cheap.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Here's some possibilities:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">-repair the cinder block and the existing footprint.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">-lay plastic pipe for a geothermal heating system, then fill in the basement.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">-build columns on the existing grade beam to support trusses and a large (40x40) platform to add design flexibility.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">-create a hidden space in the basement along the South edge of the existing basement, thus moving the south edge of the "house" above away from the well head.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I appreciate any thoughts you may have.<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am new to this site, and to the patterns. I am anxious to connect with others interested or experienced in applying the concepts.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">This June, I traveled 1500 miles by bus to attend a conference about thin shell concrete. The eclectic group has a common interest in ferrocement and some of the new concrete technologies. The conference was great, and the organizer lent me his copy of “The Pattern Language” to read on the long bus ride home. It was previously recommended within the group and I was anxious to read it. It had a profound influence on me.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Now I want to employ what I read.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Some of my experimentation with thin shell concrete led me to hyparbolic paraboloids. There are a few architectural examples; one is in Venice Beach, Florida, and the other is by Catalano. After reading the patterns, I realize that these visually stunning (to me) structures may be unsuitable to live in or difficult to make comfortable. There are many patterns to reference which influenced me: (95) Building Complex; (106) Positive Outdoor Space; (107) Wings of Light; (116) Cascade of Roofs, and; (134) Zen View; (160) Building Edge, etc.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I decided to start over from scratch.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My own circumstances are as follows:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I own a piece of Colorado mountain land and am excited to build a home.<br>
                I have a limited budget, but own the land and have many materials.<br>
                The former owner’s house burned down. Hence, a foundation, septic, and well are present.<br>
                A large garage still stands; to which I am installing electric service now.<br>
                The land is in heavily wooded terrain with scenic views in all directions.<br>
                The driveway is steep and long and runs uphill straight North.<br>
                The driveway loops around the building site.<br>
                The septic, well, and electric service are inside the driveway loop.<br>
                The garage is just outside the driveway loop.<br>
                The building site and garage spaces are along the North edge of the property.<br>
                The solar exposure is excellent and the climate is mild enough for good gardening.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The first problem I wanted to toss out to this group relates to positioning the entry. I am worried because, the best access to the future house is from the North. There is room for visitor parking (4-5). There is no way to approach the future house from the South or West edges of the site. The East edge is a basement walkout level with the garage which is 100 feet to the East. I’m having a hard time deciding if the North entry is ok or if I need to find a way to enter from the East even though the entry would be at basement level.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">What do you think?</font></p>
