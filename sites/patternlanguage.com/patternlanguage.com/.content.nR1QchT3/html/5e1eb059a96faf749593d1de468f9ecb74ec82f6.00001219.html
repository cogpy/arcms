All my design and build work is informed by CA's approach (plus that of several early 20th century Arts & Crafts architects).<br>
                I am particularly interested in CA's novel methods of project-management and could really benefit from the advice of those who have used it sucessfully. I have tried to contact CES Europe but there are no postal addresses given and my emails have received no response. This is not only frustrating, but it is a great pity. I believe that the ideas contained in CA's books have come of age and could have a real impact on the built environment. There are working designers such as myself out there who are already sympathetic but who could use some support. If CES no longer has a physical presence, please let it be known because there are surely others out here who would be happy to make it happen. It needs to exist.<br>
                So, if anyone reading this can offer the advice I'm looking for, or who can give me a real working address of CES, or who would be interested in re-creating it if it has faltered - I'd love to hear from you.</font>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">You said, "then the entire plantation is also a whole, with each tree in the plantation being its own whole within the greater whole." ... My gosh, from 2007. Has it been that long since I visited this site (Pattern Language Assn)?<br>
                <br>
                What you describe above is perhaps one of the most important characteristics of life. Let me put LIFE in caps, because it is the biological process that was born out of the interplay between matter and energy on this planet. This process brought life forth from simple molecules who nehaved according to their inner properties. We call this process, Evolution. Well, when we study its history, we see how it produced larger and larger organisms that were more and more diverse and became more and more complex and finally more and more intelligent. This is the historical trajectory of this process.<br>
                <br>
                Now there is another important property of the life process. It is the thing you referred to. It is that as organisms evolved, they also joined together for the benefit of each one. In the fight for survival, organisms join other organisms to form a super-organisms. Due to the greater inner complexity and vitality achieved by these super-organisms, they achieved a greater probability of survival than would be the case if each sub-organism tried to survive on their own. This pattern is seen throughout the plant and animal kingdoms from the microscopic cells, bodily organs and organ systems, to the anthills and beehives, to the flocks of birds and herds of animals, to the primate families, tribes, races, religions, nations and perhaps, someday, a single planetary ecosystem.<br>
                <br>
                Whether or not that arrives, there is a basic principle that surviving systems follow. When individuals enter a larger social system, in response for the nourishment and protection they receive they must in some way contribute back to the community of which they are a part. If they do not contribute, they become a parasite and reduce the survivability of the total community. This is why it is so important when we design homes and neighborhoods and towns we give a high priority to spaces that facilitate its members being able to help one another. As an elderly person, I feel proud of every contribution I am able to make to my family's prosperity, health and quality of life. I also contribute to the future of our neighborhood, town and country. It is not just an obligation. It makes me feel better and more alive. I am thankful that I can contribute. I wish there were more opportunities to contribute.<br>

On specifics I see many suggestions put forward that from my experience in Europe suggests they do not work. (I live in California, Belgium and France where I am able to study a wide range of patterns.) I believe that the future of life grows out of its constituent parts and that we have to choose from the most synergistic surviving patterns.

When the seed sprouts, the cell divides, makes two wholes, with two centers, which both divide, making four, etc. When it divides a lot more and becomes a whole new plant, it still has all those individual cells, each of which is a whole in it's self, each of which has it's own nucleas, it's own little center.

                see some interesting comments and questions but<br>
                wish more peole would post here. I have continued<br>
                to grow in my understanding of living space and<br>
                centers seeing how some places become centers of<br>
                life and others quench the spirit. I am facinated<br>
                about how this might affect places of worship and<br>
                the sense of Divinity. Some of ancients knew God<br>
                could not live in a place but tried anyway to house<br>
                The Divine inspite of revelation. Others thought<br>
                Diety needed a house on earth where God and man<br>
                could intersect. I recently entered a place of<br>
                worship that promoted life and "centers" in every<br>
                way. It is the St. Leo's Church in Sonoma California.<br>
                Multiple souces of natural light from three<br>
                directions. Proportions that embrace the worshiper<br>
                yet give room for the spirit to grow. A floor to<br>
                ceiling view of a garden and natural meadow<br>
                behind the altar. Widely placed seating that brings<br>
                more people into closer contact with the front.<br>
                Decorative arts (3D painted wood carvings) in the<br>
                form of small stations of the cross no higher than a<br>
                foot adorn the headers of the giant light well<br>
                personalizing the place and inviting deeper<br>
                contemplation.<br>
                I have been in many temples, churches and<br>
                mosques. Some are so imposing and lifeless that I<br>
                am amazed anyone comes. Others like St. Leo's<br>
                have shaped a place that has a life of it's own. If<br>
                you're in Sonoma make sure you visit this place and<br>
                add your own signiture of spirit.</font>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am interested in people's thoughts on designing<br>
                progressive architecture to house farm animals. I<br>
                believe there is too much disconnect between farm<br>
                animals and people, which has produced a very<br>
                disturbing, chronic lack of empathy in our World<br>
                concerning their quality of Life. I believe a well-<br>
                designed farm is an achievement of profound<br>
                beauty. Im not talking about an ego-driven<br>
                'showplace' of fancy stables and the like (which<br>
                strike me as decorated prisons to a large extent),<br>
                but an authentically harmonious environment<br>
                where both human and animal needs are<br>
                addressed. Even those of us who do not literally<br>
                live with animals, live in a World full of<br>
                animals...and I wonder if humans were more<br>
                conscious of this reality would they then begin too<br>
                construct buildings and communities which<br>
                possessed a deeper sense of interconnectedness<br>
                and a more sophisticated & balanced essence.? I<br>
                find it provocative that the subtle complexities of<br>
                existing with other species (maybe farm animals are<br>
                not exotic enough?) has not inspired more<br>
                architects. You see many examples of 'Nature'<br>
                sensitive architecture, 'Green' architecture, but one<br>
                of the most fundamental relationships in human<br>
                history, man living with farm animals, essentially<br>
                ignored or prescribed in industrial terms.</font>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hey, this is Stephen Henderson, I'm a second year Architecture student at Texas A&M, I discovered the Nature of Order by chance on a stranger's blog-post. After that it was recommended by a favorite author/speaker's blog. So I was happy to find that my college library had the books.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Right now I'm about 80 pgs into book one and find it very interesting. As a Christian, I find it interesting how close he comes to the Christian worldveiw at times.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">It is refreshing to see some-one else who is against the modern, and he is perceptive to trace bad architecture to a worldveiw based on false premises.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">As someone once said, "Ideas have consequences".</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Before you can think rightly about architecture, you must think rightly about the world around you, others, and yourself. Though he is reluctant to say it out right, I think our Worldveiws, and in turn Architecture, hang most primarally on the question of theology or atheology.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">What is most Ultimate? God? Who is God? If there is no god, then what is most ultimate? The universe? What is it's nature? etc.</font></p>
