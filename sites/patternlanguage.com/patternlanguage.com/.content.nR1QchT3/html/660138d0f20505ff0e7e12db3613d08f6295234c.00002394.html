    </table>Even more than the places, and the informal atmosphere, is the HUMAN atmosphere.
    <p>What is even more important, most valuable is the human spirit which exists in Duncanville. It lies in the way people treat each other, a sense of common purpose, a gentle way that people call each other by name, and talk together.</p>
    <p>After talking for eight months with Earle Jones and Steve Madison, I had a feeling that people of Duncanville value their community. But I had no idea that it was genuine, nor how deeply felt it was. When Dr Quillien and I came to Duncanville on Sunday noon, January 19, 2003, within five or ten minutes we began to feel it all around us, and knew that it was true.</p>
    <p>As we talked, and came to know people, in formal and informal situations, within two or three days we began to recognize the deep resource, the enormous prosperity and love of life, which exists in the way people are related to each other, and in the way they treat each other.</p>
    <p>We came to understand that the people of Duncanville themselves value this human spirit as their most important and most valuable possession. But, in many cases, they are not fully aware -- anyway not deeply enough aware -- that this treasure of human relationships is sustained by <i>some</i> of the places, by <i>some</i> of the buildings, by <i>some</i> of the outdoor areas- - and that it is <i>threatened or damaged</i> by others.</p>
    <p>In the effort to find a way forward, and a way of sustaining the community of Duncanville, the most important issue is to find that backbone of physical structure which supports, sustains, and permits and encourages, the treasure of human love and human relationships, in that place -- so that the greatest strength of Duncanville, can flourish successfully, and prosper.</p>
