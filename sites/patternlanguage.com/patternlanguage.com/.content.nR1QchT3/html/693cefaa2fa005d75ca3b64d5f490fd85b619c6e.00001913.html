          Like many others, I do not believe that man can live by bread alone. The mystery of art, even the humble making of a small bench, or tile, depend on aspects of reality, far far beyond the analytical and mechanical realities that were most often admitted by 20th century thought. And they are equally far, even further, from the image-driven fantasies which have been popular as icons of architecture in the last twenty years.</font>

                  <p><font color="brown">It is the living structure of buildings which awakens a connection with (<i>this</i>) personal feeling. The more that it appears in a building, the more it awakens this feeling in us. Indeed, we may say, truly, that a building has life in it to the extent that it awakens this connection to the personal. Or, in other language, we may say that a building has life in it, to the extent it awakens the connection to the eternal vastness which existed before me, and around me, and after me.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="brown">I believe that this is true, not just a nice way of talking. As I try to explain it quietly, for all its grandeur, and try to make the artist's experience real, I hope that you, with me, will also catch in it a glimpse of a modified picture of the universe. For, in my view, there is a core of fact here -- a personal nature in what seems impersonal -- that both underpins the nature of architecture in its ultimate meaning and will also, one day, force a revision in our idea of the universe.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="brown">I believe it is in the nature of matter, that it is soaked through with self or "I." The essence of the argument which I am putting before you throughout Book 4 is that the thing we call "the self," which lies at the core of our experience, is a real thing, existing in all matter, beyond ourselves, and that in the end we must understand it, in order to make living structure in buildings. But it is also my argument that this is the nature of "matter". It is not only necessary to understand it when we wish to make living structure in buildings. It is also necessary if we wish to grasp our place in the universe, our relationship to nature.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="brown">That argument -- that difficult intellectual path -- is the path which lies before us in this book."</font></p>
