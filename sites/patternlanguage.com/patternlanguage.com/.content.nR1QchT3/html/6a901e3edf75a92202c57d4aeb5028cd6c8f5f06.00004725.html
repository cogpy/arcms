          <p>A non-profit corporation,established in 1967, The Center for Environmental Structure implements building projects in which towns, landscape, buildings, gardens, are truly adapted to support human existence.</p>
          <p>CES provides publicly accessible models of working processes able to alter the procurement of buildings throughout the world.</p>
          <p>We seek to do this in a fashion which permits the creation of a better architecture and provides professional and lay people with working models for new projects in the twenty--first century. Pilot projects of small and moderate size are gradually to be replaced by projects in which size, scale, and impact increase, and are able to be competitive with those very large projects which are now damaging cities and countryside everywhere, in the United States, in the European world, in Latin America, in Asia, and in Africa. The projects we take on have as an explicit aim, the purpose of extending tested mechanisms and processes of implementation to larger and larger cases which can, within a finite time, begin to have impact on the conduct of architecture and planning in the world.</p>

          <p>Fundamental to our aims, is the fostering of a certain quality in the built environment. For convenience, we call this quality life. In a living environment, as we wish to define it, the people who live and work there are relaxed, know that they belong there and enjoy a kind of freedom in relation to the buildings and space around them. They feel and are “at home” in their world.</p>
          <p>In looking around us we can most frequently see this quality in traditional buildings and towns, where, over the years, people have constructed an orderly but loose configuration of space, rooms, gardens, houses, and larger buildings. The later 20th century, for varied and complex reasons, has not seen much in the way of living buildings and neighborhoods.</p>
          <p>The idea of CES is not to engage in a nostalgia for past centuries, but to develop a modern interpretation of living structures that can speak to us, our cultural specificity, and to our times, and yet reach this deep understanding of spatial arrangements that support rather than deny humanity and ordinary daily events.</p>
          <p>Many ingredients are required to make a living structure: an understanding of space and human response to it, appropriate technology and materials, constructing, from the outset, with and for the people who will adopt that space as their own, and even arranging for the way that money flows for initial construction, later repairs, adaptation, and growth. The key for CES is in understanding and developing the processes by which living environments can come into existence and prosper.</p>

          <p>The most fundamental aspect of CES innovation and practice, concerns the necessity to revise and reconstruct social, technical, banking, and human process, throughout the field of building and environment.</p>
          <p>We are committed to the view that a good, healthy, and beneficial environment for human beings in the 21st century, can only be created by thoroughgoing changes in the systems and processes in use during the 20th century.</p>
          <p>During the last thirty years we have frequently proposed, and made, innovations of process. At one time or another, we have proposed changes in almost all the processes that create buildings, because for over thirty years we have tried to identify the kinds of process that are <b>capable</b> of creating a living world. Some of our process innovations include:</p><span class="h5class"></span>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="h5class">Analysis of a design task in terms of its functional roots</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Finite element analysis of complex forms as a method of cycling engineering solutions</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Involvement of users and lay people in the design process of their houses and workplaces</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Fixed-fee, non--profit management of construction</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">New forms of construction contract</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Changes in the flow of money</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Inventions in construction technique designed to create physical processes that could allow formation of well--adapted, cheap, buildings</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">The nature of the human process that is used to lay out a building</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">The experimental human process needed to improve layout of building interiors</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Changes in process for consecutive layout and siting of buildings in urban design and construction of city centers</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Mechanical innovations in setting out the foundations of a building</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Innovations in engineering process and analysis to get better results in engineering design</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Innovations in public diagnosis of a community environment leading to changes of process</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Innovations in the relative order of items in a construction procedure</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Innovation in the manufacturing process for office furniture designed to make the furniture better adapted to individual needs</span></li>
            <li><span class="h5class">Changes in the maintenance of buildings, and the maintenance budget and its distribution over the lifetime of the building</span></li>
          </ul><span class="h5class"></span>
          <p>These innovations have all been innovations of <b>process.</b> We made them because we knew the value of the living architecture we were trying to achieve was dependent on changes in process, and could only be created by these or other equivalent process changes. These process--innovations were often dismissed as dreaming, as not essential, as too radical for architects to propose. Nevertheless, experience has taught us that fundamental practical innovations of process are necessary consequences of thinking correctly about the nature of life, and of facing honestly the task of creating living structure in the world.</p>

New forms of construction management contracts, invented and developed by CES, have provided managed methods of cost control which provide the client the opportunity to obtain maximum benefit for any given level of cost, with security of final cost.</p>
          <p>Vital to the welfare of the environment, is the possibility of flexible adaptations during construction, and methods of providing that this flexibility can be maintained within a guaranteed cost umbrella. Our innovations provide clients with the advantages of flexibility, without the costs and penalties and cost--overruns typically encountered when construction proceeds within existing forms of bidding and cost control.</p>
