      The possibility of making Main Street into a major artery for community, business and commerce, but functioning in a new way which places emphasis on human and community values, joined and wedded to the efforts of small business and synergy among small businesses along the street was first articulated by Mayor Glenn Repp, and the vision of this change of function in Main Street has now been established as a community-wide movement in Duncanville.<br>
      The city, through such organisations as the Planning and Zoning Board, Keep Duncanville Beautiful, Chamber of Commerce, Board for Economic Development, City Council, Mayor Repp and City Manager, Kent Cagel, intends to build the most advanced, fully sustainable, small-town economic-market-corridor in the United States, with some three and a half miles of arterial corridor, to be transformed into a highly accessible pedestrian-oriented marketplace and center for family life.</td>
