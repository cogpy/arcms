                <blockquote>
                  <font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">What we mean by a good building is one that has a certain quality, what we normally call "life."</font></font>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">In a living environment, as we define it, the people who live and work there are relaxed, know that they belong there and enjoy a kind of freedom in relation to the buildings and space around them. They feel and are “at home” in their world.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">In looking around us we can most frequently see this quality in traditional buildings and towns, where, over the years, people have constructed an orderly but loose configuration of space, rooms, gardens, houses, and larger buildings. The later 20th century, for varied and complex reasons, has not seen much in the way of living buildings and neighborhoods.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">We do not wish to engage in a nostalgia for past centuries, but to develop a modern interpretation of living structures that can speak to us, our cultural specificity, and to our times, and yet reach this deep understanding of spatial arrangements that support rather than deny humanity and ordinary daily events.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">Many ingredients are required to make a living structure: an understanding of space and human response to it, appropriate technology and materials., constructing, from the outset, with and for the people who will adopt that space as their own, and even arranging for the way that money flows for initial construction, later repairs, adaptation, and growth. The key is in understanding and developing the processes by which living environments can come into existence and prosper.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">Sometimes a picture is worth a thousand words. The <a href="../picturegallery/picturegallery.htm" target="_top">Picture Gallery</a> shows you some of the buildings we have made in this spirit.</font></font></p>
