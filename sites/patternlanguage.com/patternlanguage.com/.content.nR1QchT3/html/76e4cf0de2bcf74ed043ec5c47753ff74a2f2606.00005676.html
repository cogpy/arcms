                      <font color="#CCCCCC"></font>
                      <p><font color="#CCCCCC"></font></p>

                      <h5><font color="#CCCCCC">It used to be that homes were made for people. Originally a house was built by a family to give them a place where they could happily exist. These homes were made out of natural substances found in the area, and they were made as useful places which housed all kinds of activities.</font></h5>
                      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">As architecture developed, cities grew and suburbs sprang up, the building of homes became depersonalized. No matter whether it was an expensive or low cost home, the buildings had lost their character. Many modern homes were made with the wrong reasons. Either they were made as showcases for the rich, or developments, made without thought, to throw the poor into. Buildings became out of touch with the earth and the people living in them. A lot of modern architecture followed this pattern.</font></p>
                      <p><font color="#CCCCCC">On this website we hope to give you the opportunity to change these conditions. Here we offer you the tools to make an environment in which you can co-exist with your home, not just live there. You can make the place which you dream of, whether it is a doorway, a kitchen, an addition or a home. We want, ultimately, to give each of you -- to each person -- the ability to make the most beautiful structure you can, for an affordable cost. Although the larger aims are to make the whole world a more beautiful place, our immediate aims are to help individuals reach this goal in their own lives. We will give you the ability to make something that does not just look nice with its untouchable decoration, but instead, a place where you are at home and happy; a place which lives and breathes its beauty around you.<br>
