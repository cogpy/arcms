  <h1><img src="http://www.c2.com/cgi/wiki.gif"> <a href="fullSearch">Design Patterns</a></h1><em>Each pattern describes a problem which occurs over and over again in our environment, and then describes the core of the solution to that problem, in such a way that you can use this solution a million times over, without ever doing it the same way twice.</em> -- <a href="">ChristopherAlexander</a>
  <p></p><em>A design pattern systematically names, motivates, and explains a general design that addresses a recurring design problem in object-oriented systems. It describes the problem, the solution, when to apply the solution, and its consequences. It also gives implementation hints and examples. The solution is a general arrangement of objects and classes that solve the problem. The solution is customized and implemented to solve the problem in a particular context.</em> -- DesignPatternsBook.
