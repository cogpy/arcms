                  <p>Bill Joy’s article which first appeared on the net version of <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Wired</span> on April 5,was marked most vividly for me by a short editorial commentary written on the same day, by Lakshmi Chaudhry.</p>
                  <p>Chaudhry, writing on the front page of the technology section of <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Wired</span>, began like this:</p>
                  <h5>"Valley to Bill Joy: 'Zzzzzzz' The information revolution's giddy rush to worship science gets a drubbing from critics such as Bill Joy, who says we're ignoring the little things -- like ethics. The Valley, of course, disagrees.<br>
                  <br>
                  The bells are tolling for the cyberchurch, but the parishioners remain unfazed.<br>
                  <br>
                  Sun Microsystems' co-founder Bill Joy warns our exaltation of technology reveals a fundamental &quot;bug in scientific thinking&quot; that prioritizes progress even at the risk of extinction. The problem, he says, is not with technology but our attitude toward it.<br>
                  <br>
                  Silicon Valley is not impressed."</h5>
                  <p></p>
                  <p>I read these words, and felt at once what a remarkably short-sighted response this was, from a major magazine which prides itself on intelligent and responsible commentary. Even allowing for hype journalism, and for attention-getting exaggeration, I felt this was an irresponsibly blind-alley way of addressing the issues which Bill Joy opens up in his April piece, and which he has addressed in other recent articles such as his March 6 article in Fortune.</p>
                  <p>In effect Joy is saying, and has been saying for some time: “<u>There are aspects of computer science, silicon valley, current technology, which are all missing on one cylinder: they lack a moral dimension. We need to become more aware of the moral dimension of what we do.”</u></p>
                  <p>I do believe that Chaudhry was reflecting the views of many <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Wired</span> readers with her statement. In this sense her words might be said to be reporting, accurately, a pervasive feeling in the present-day technical community, indeed a current which runs throughout much of society today. Yet that is just the problem. And the question is, whether we can survive, and whether society can survive, so long as we keep these particular blinders on our faces and on our eyes and ears.</p>
                  <p>A few months ago, I went to an evening discussion on “The Long Boom,” at Global Business Network in Emeryville, by co-founders Stewart Brand and Peter Schwartz. It was an optimistic discussion about the fascinating, exploding future, what it may hold for us, what it might be like. The two speakers, and the audience, were invited to speculate about the most far-out things they could imagine, in society and technology, and what the future might hold: how -- in a word -- the future might be different from the present.</p>
                  <p>The discussion, and the audience comments, were entirely dominated by techno-thinking. The issues covered included new materials, new forms of social organization, new relationships between the sexes, new forms of gene-splicing and gene control, biological warfare and biological control systems. All this was predictable and interesting. What was not predictable, to me, was the remarkably, and exclusively non-human, or inhumane focus of the discussion. It was, I am sure, quite unintended. But it was nevertheless remarkable. Ethics were not discussed. The sense of right and wrong were not discussed. Consciousness was not discussed. The intense search now going on in physics, to find, and recognize consciousness or mind as part of the universe was not discussed. God was not discussed, in any of his or her manifestations. None of these major topics was brought up by any speaker, on the platform or in the audience, as part of their vision of the future.</p>
                  <p>In short, among an audience of whiz-kid scientists and technologists, probably coming largely from Berkeley, Palo Alto, and San Francisco, the preoccupation with palmtops, gadgets, light pens, radio laptops, and a host of far more wild technological things, had all but pushed thought about the major human concerns into the background. It was indeed like being in a roomful of whiz kids – school kids – not yet mature enough to grasp for the ungraspable, nor to focus their thinking on the matters which underlie every human heart.</p>
                  <p>Is <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Wired</span>, too, peopled only by Whiz kids who are too scared to discuss frankly, the issues of feeling , consciousness, and right and wrong, which are the marks of being human? Can <span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Wired</span>, too, only talk about what is “cool.”</p>
                  <p>That, I believe, is what Bill Joy has been trying to say<u>. “Cool is not SO cool. Technics is not enough, and if taken in isolation will be dangerous. To be leaders in the world, computer scientists and creators of technology need to, and must wake up to embrace a view of the world which is moral, based on ultimate realities of cosmology. No matter how hard it is to embrace these things clearly, to find a world view in which they play the central role, human existence cannot make sense without them. When will the Valley, which has brought so much to the world, and which leads on so many fronts, become a leader intellectually, in the human things which matter.”</u></p><br>
                  <br>
                  <p>It is my belief that the next decades must be shaped by a sincere effort to find structural ways of coping with life and not-life, good and evil, love above all, and the meaning of life. These are not sophomoric questions which can be discarded because Silicon Valley is “adult.” Many thinkers and artists and technologists in the world today, are seeking ways of dealing with these matters – and we are succeeding. We have recently discovered that there are new ways of dealing, in modern and hypermodern terms, with ancient questions which lie at the roots of our experience and our humanity.</p>
                  <p>Bill has been honest enough to give expression to doubts and concerns. He is not a pulpit bashing moralist. He is a person who knows priorities, and even in his honest and refreshing posture of ignorance, seeks to find out how to break the crystal barriers of our technology, which he himself has helped to create. That needs applause, interest, support. Above all it needs <u>support</u>.</p>
                  <p><span style='text-transform:uppercase'>Wired</span> did well to publish the article, and should now open a decade of discussion of these imponderable issues, and bring them as sharply as possible into focus.</p>
