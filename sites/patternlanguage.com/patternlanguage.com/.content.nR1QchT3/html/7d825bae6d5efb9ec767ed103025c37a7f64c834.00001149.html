                  <font color="black">For many years Christopher Alexander, like an obsessed Sherlock Holmes, spent much of his energy, time, and income in the search for rare rugs. His collection of early (13th to 15th century) Anatolian carpets is now one of the finest and well known in the world.</font>
                  <p><font color="black">He studied these carpets. He analysed and sketched the intricate patterns to understand exactly how they were formed. He observed how colors were juxtapositioned by the weavers and worked more himself with paint.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="black">These carpets were his most important teachers. They taught him color. They taught him geometry. They taught him that only the weavers who stretched beyond themselves to the prayers for which they were made, actually reached real artistic force.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="black">This book tells the story of the collection and the story of the lessons that bridge more than 500 years.</font></p>

                <blockquote>
                  <font color="black">The great carpets were not secular objects of beauty. The inspiration, motivation and purpose was to reach the infinite and express the metaphysical principle of Unity. This motivation was the source for the geometrical structure of the rugs with border and window. The 'void' glimpsed through the &quot;window&quot; pointed toward the &quot;the truth that God is completely beyond all that the ordinary mind and the senses can conceive as reality.&quot; The arabesque &quot;removed from the eye the possibility of fixing itself in one place and from the mind the possibility of becoming imprisoned in any particular crysallisation of matter. . .&quot;</font>
                  <p><font color="black">This motivation was the source of the intensity of structure requiring every tiny knot of 1/8 of an inch to contribute to a well formed shape. Colors were placed so that they brought each other forth with an unusal light and intensity. The proportion of large designs and tiny details, the interlocking of shapes and symmetries all played a part in created carpets of stunning depth and subtlety whose purpose was to help bring our minds and hearts to contemplate God.</font></p>
                  <p><font color="black">In Part 1 the motivation of the weavers and its impact on the artifact, the understanding of subtle geometry and the color are the focus. There is also the introduction to the technique of &quot;the mirror of the self&quot; which gives a solid basis for discussing which carpet is &quot;better&quot; than another. In a broader context, the mirror of the self methodology is a major innovation and contribution to the question of how beauty, be it in carpets or buildings, can be sanely and objectively discussed.</font></p>

With sketches and detailed discussion, the reader is guided to an full understanding of the geometry and color principles laid out in the first part of the book. The carpets by their uniqueness, and differences inform each other as the collection unfolds. A 20 year painstaking study can be assimilated readily and with pleasure and without any necessary prior knowledge of this kind of artifact.</font>
