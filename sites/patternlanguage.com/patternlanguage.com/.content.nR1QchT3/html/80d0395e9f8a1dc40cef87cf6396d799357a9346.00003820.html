                  <font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">The emphasis of this web site -- and the source of its power as a tool which can help you design things for yourself -- is on sequences: sequences of patterns which allow a person to design a coherent building and which help to make it more probable that the building, as designed, has life and living structure. The new sequences are sophisticated and powerful, and flexible.</font></font>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">However, the original pattern language, too, had a kind of capacity to give a person approximate sequences. Though they are less sophisticated, they are still useful, and they do cover an enormous range of topics not yet available to the user as sophisticated modern sequences.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">For this reason, we do make available the "old" pattern sequences, for the users benefit. By visiting <a href="../sitemap/bookshelf.htm#users">the bookshelf (Old style sequences)</a>, you will find a volume called <font color="yellow">LanguageBuilder</font>. In this volume the user can obtain useful sequences of patterns, and can use them, for a very large variety of design and construction and planning problems.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">We do not stand behind these sequences with the same confidence, because they reflect a more archaic form of theory, which only works in an approximate way. Nevertheless, because they are useful, and because thousands of users all over the world do use them, we make them available here for all the benefit a user can extract from them.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">You may find them by going to the <a href="../languagebuilder/languagebuilder.htm" target="_top">old style sequence generator in the pattern language</a>, and can then form useful sequences for almost any design problem.</font></font></p>
