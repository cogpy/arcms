        <p>In this document we shall describe the form, character, and method of production of the houses in the neighborhoods of Guasare new town.</p>
        <p>It is intended that Guasare new town will make a major breakthrough in the problem of housing production, in Venezuela, and in the world. In particular, the housing in the neighborhoods is intended to have a humane and personal character, intimate in feeling, and strongly related to the individuality and needs of the users. It is intended to remove, entirely, the alienation and despair produced by so-called mass housing, in most forms of housing production throughout the world.</p>
        <p>Each neighborhood will be laid out according to a system of fundamental principles which are described in chapter 1. These principles define the position of streets, location of major public space and public buildings in the neighborhood, minor streets, subdivision of lots, and arrangement of lots to guarantee the climatic suitability of the individual houses.</p>
        <p>The density and layout of lots is such that individual lots will have about 470 m<sup>2</sup> each, thus making it possible for each family to build a good house, and also keep a large garden for agriculture, fruit trees, animals, or recreation. This is in keeping with the rural character of the region, and with the character of life and vegetation in the immediate Guasare area.</p>
        <p>The range of financing packages will be such that every single family who comes to the Guasare area will be entitled to receive a lot which they can pay for very slowly, according to their capacity to pay: and there is a sufficiently wide raange of financing schemes so that every single family will be able to have a house of some kind, large or small.</p>
        <p>In a typical neighborhood of 200 families, only about 20 houses will be built without the involvement of families. One hundred and eighty houses will be built according to the wishes of the family, and according to the specific needs of their own day-to-day life. Of these 180 houses, about 30 will be fully financed and built in one time period. Of the remaining 150 houses, all will receive financing sufficient for the construction of one or two rooms: and other financing programs will then ensure the possibility that the family can add new rooms every year or two, and complete a house of 80 m<sup>2</sup> within four to seven years.</p>
        <p>Most of the construction in this very rich and varied program will be provided by a professional construction company, according to the specification of the families.</p>
        <p>However, in addition, the methods of financing will allow selfhelp (construction undertaken by the families themselves), or additions done by small local builders. Each neighborhood will have a local builder's yard, managed by Proguasare, which will provide materials and assistance for self-help construction, and which will simultaneously coordinate and administer the process by which families design their own houses, and have them built by the construction company.</p>
        <p>The program of construction will have one additional quality, which is essential to the well-being of the new town. It is so organized that all houses will have some garden walls, some trees, some ornament in the construction itself, and some beautiful colors on the outside of the houses. Thus the streets are themselves taken care of by the program of construction, and made into happy, beautiful places which reflect the spirit of the people... and have more relationship with traditional Venezuelan building than with the mass housing of recent towns.</p>
        <p>In the following chapters, we shall define the detailed programs and processes needed to implement this general plan. The chapters are organized as follows:</p>
        <p>1. The layout of the neighborhood.<br>
        2. The layout of individual houses.<br>
        3. Financing and administration of houses.<br>
        4. Construction and embellishment of streets.<br>
        5. Outline of a contract for implementation.</p>
