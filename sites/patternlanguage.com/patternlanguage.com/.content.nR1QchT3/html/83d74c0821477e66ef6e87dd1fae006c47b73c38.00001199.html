                Thanks for your feed back. One point, the numbering can be done in any scattered way-as long as they maintian a sequence in this discussion-it need not be added to the same list-what do you think?<br>
                Starting from the patterns Vasko suggested let us put numbers like the following:<br>
                5.Sustaining Community Life<br>
                5.1 Lively Neighbourhoods<br>
                5.1.1 Neighbourly Interaction<br>
                5.1.1.1 Drinking with Friends<br>
                5.1.1.1.1 Art of Drinking<br>
                5.1.1.1.1.1 Art of WineMaking<br>
                5.1.1.1.1.1.1 Steps To Prepare Wine<br>
                5.1.1.1.1.2 Place to Drink<br>
                5.1.1.1.1.3 Retreat with Friends<br>
                6. The Art of Loosing Oneself in Different Cultures<br>
                6.1 Belief System and intoxication.<br>
                Why the patterns came out to be related like this? Because I am interested in a particular scene which will provide a place for making wine at your home where you not only make and store wine<br>
                but also entertain and celebrate and exchange ideas and tell stories,jokes and just go beyond ordinary every day routine work. So the pattern "drinking with Friends" will infact bring forth issues which go much beyond drinking for intoxication. It will probably explore possibility of being drunk without being intoxicated. It will<br>
                explore what the word "drunk" can really mean.Those issues will trickle down to the Art of Drinking where it will possibly talk about actual drinking styles-the type of bottle<br>
                and glass,table used and so on ,will come to type of place and structure where you feel comfortable with different variations of mood- different kinds of people. These will all add up to the disign of the wine cellar where for some mysterious reason every one loves to visit and share a bottle while you chat away about things in life.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The reason why the wine cellar became burrried in so deep nesting of Patterns is you wanted to link it with the pattern "Lively Neighbourhoods". The point I am making is firstly Pattern nesting is necessary to bring multiple aspects or issues play in the solution and secondly the way patterns are nested is very much dependent on the particular solution or "scene". Also point to remember patterns can influnce a scene without being nested in the hierarchy.e.g 5 and 6 above.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman"><br>
                The relation ships between Scene and Patterns is very vital. The structure you are mentioning is relative to the Scene, where as each individual pattern has it own existance as a sequence of scenes.You are adding one scene to an existing sequences in every pattern so that each pattern still maintains a continuity in its own right through the focuses marked at every member scene. I have arrived at this model after studying the nature of science,problems,investigations and solutions and of many different aspects of life and human interaction. Scene has come out to me as real life snap shots that has no real boundaries. The cross between the<br>
                pattern and the scnes I call Focus is a collection of "key-points"-each being a phrase or a word and can be regarded as the smallest unit of understanding. Such key points can also have a measure or value associated with it. Scene can be physical world details or mental images or a mix of both. So by "real Life" I include both<br>
                real world and mental world almost in one breadth. Focus is one point of attention.<br>
                The fun starts when we build a computational model out of this picture-the analogy is to a travelling<br>
                tourist which represents human way of understanding things. As the tourist travels from one focus to another<br>
                on a pattern tour,the tourist builds a collection of keypoints similar to the way we human beings build up our background with experiences in real life [education included] and understanding.<br>
                So the model says you and I always learn and act through patterns and nothing but patterns but at the same time we act differently at each scene because our background is different. At each focus the tourist also invokes "intentions" which are either<br>
                questions or observations. Each such question or observation add keypoints to tourists collection aswell.<br>
                Ofcourse I am still to develop a fully working model of what I have said and<br>
                implement into todays software technology -where main practical outcome will be the availability of software that will have an agent between the user of the software and the developer of the software. This agent will have an idea of the user's background and the developers background and shall act as the bridge between the two by faciliatating some ride through the patterns which both user and developer understands. This will solve the problem of design reuse I spoke about before.<br>
                Hope you find this interesting.<br>
                Speak to you soon.<br>
                Thanks</font></p>

              <blockquote>
                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi everybody,</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Pronob, thanks for your latest addition. What you are really talking about is the structure of pattern languages? l am trying to get a handle on your idea of how the scenes and patterns relate. l remember reading a paper by Nikos Salingaros on this subject. It was very much along these lines. Anyone interested can find his paper in his home page in his online books about architecture (if you haven't seen already).<br>
                l would propose that small, bite size articles like Salingaros's, as an example, could be topic papers for small study groups. These papers give good theoretical background to patterns ideas.<br>
                So, yes l am interested in the study groups.<br>
                Pronob, your compilation of patterns has also urged me to think about writing patterns, for this is what you are in essence doing and urging for us to do.<br>
                And, it has occured to me that my earlier talk about 're-discovering' or 'articulating' patterns from our communities, in essence really is the requirement for the skill to be able to write patterns.<br>
                Most of us live the patterns, even implement them in one way or another, whether we do it as professional designers or lay people going about our daily lives, re-arranging the furniture, building a fence, planting a vegetable garden, whatever. But writing the patterns is different.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Georgina your offer to host a conference, or at least a 'convergence'in your town, of interested people, sounds great. Some sort of convergence, or coming together would possibly concretise particular outcomes and pursuits for different people. It's just a matter of how and when. So if anyone would like to further the proposal, let's see what we can do.<br>
                l would be happy to play some role in facilitating the process of getting people together in 'real' space.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">But, to get back to patterns, l would like to add some more patterns to Pronobs list. (l think they are patterns).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">This morning, on my way to the market, l saw the first grapes coming to Melbourne. They come on trucks, delivered from various parts of country Victoria. People from the community come to these places where the trucks wait, every year, in autumn, groups of men, very early to buy the grapes to make wine at home with their friends.<br>
                Appart from the fact that this alone, constitutes a pattern of some sort- it brings to mind other patterns, some related and some not directly related to this one.<br>
                So my main pattern is 'sustaining community life' then 'lively neighbourhoods', with 'Making wine' as a sub pattern for this larger pattern.<br>
                Under 'lively neighbourhoods', there could be other, more specific, more focused patterns, like 'sharing food', 'helping with work', 'food production', then more specific, down to 'crushing grapes', 'bottling and storing the wine', all the way down to, (excuse the pun, no humor intended) 'wine cellar' which itself becomes a 'implementation' pattern. Here we design a wine cellar for the storage of the wine.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So, Pronob, l would like to try and add at least two patterns to your list. My guess is that 'lively neighbourhoods' should go somewhere amongst the first four, while 'sustaining community life', being more general, somewhere before the first four. 'Wine cellar' on the other hand might fit into ???<br>
                While the other patterns like 'sharing food', 'helping with work', 'making and bottling wine' might go under 2.?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">What l have left out so far is where to make the wine. This is another 'implementation' pattern, that is, a pattern which manifests in a particular geometry of a space somewhere, where the pattern can happen. But this pattern, and its space is more difficult to define. It is more difficult because wine making is not the only thing (its one scene of many??), that sustains communities, makes neighbourhoods lively, or feeds people at the end of the day. There are other things like, making bread, collecting eggs, growing vegetables, roasting and storing capsicums, not to mention non-dietary needs, etc... and most often these things happen together or in different seasons throughout the year and within the geometry of the space of the neighbourhood or the immediate house. They overlap. So the space for making wine for exapmle must accomodate other activities which sustain the community. So, why do l find it more difficult to put my finger on this space, to find its definite spatial arrangement and character, while 'wine cellar' is easier?<br>
                l know the wine cellar, generally goes under the house, should be accessible from the area where the wine is made, but should not be too public or announce its entrance, it should be in a cool place, out of the sun etc. etc...<br>
                If l think back of all the times l saw wine being made, families coming together to make wine, l still can not define exactly what the character of the space was that allowed wine making for example to happen. Or put in another way, if someone asked me, 'design me a place where to make wine?' l would not know where to start. l would say, you can do it any where, outside in the yard, inside the garage, in the middle of the garden, anywhere, as long as there is enough space to 'swing a cat' you can set your stuff up there and make the wine. You don't need much space, or any specially arranged space, so far as l have been able to identify.<br>
                The same thing goes for other activities. Harvesting the last vegetables from that years garden, cooking them, storing them etc... They all happened, over and over again, year after year, season through season. Families came and went, friendships and relationships changed, but people in the community made wine, wether it was with the same family as last year or a new family, it happened.<br>
                l can't define the precise character of that space, but l can describe elements of it which made the making of wine and all the other acivities which sustain and make communities lively possible.<br>
                For example, most households had a vegetable garden, often there was a gate between the yards, and often the gate was in the vegetable garden, there was a outdoor kitchen, tap, some sort of gas stove or even outdoor wood oven, a covered area where everyone could sit out of the rain or in the shade, where you could push the hot heap of burning embers and coals out of the rain for the last few capsicums and on and on...<br>
                It's all very amorphous, and difficult to pin point at times.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Apologies for rambling, but its raining today and there's nothing else to do.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">These patterns are also quite culturally specific, they come from peasant communities, cold climate, but l suppose they can also apply or be relevant to anyone who drinks wine, eats vegetables, grows food etc...</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l would like to get to your other point Pronob about "how different sections of the community can interact to bring up a solution"...</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">At this stage however, l well pause for any responses to our discussions.</font></p>

                My only other comment is that houses have more than one side, and even if they are terraces, will have e/w or n/s either position can be utilised to the best advantage. Most houses and be turned around inside without too much trouble.<br>

                I was thrilled to look at the range of the discussions and proposed patterns.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Toby’s remark on the capitalisim as a pattern language is appealing. In fact I was thinking along similar line after reading Georgina's response. New pattern language will certainly evolve to give formation to new ..isms needed to replace capitalism. But in fact pattern language has something more powerful than any ..ism can deliver. That is because pattern language can bring in the dynamism bottom up and can allow multiple isms to coexist. That is why pattern languages are closer to life.<br>
                Also I have just received the first book in the Nature Of Order series. This is an extraordinarily revealing ,wonderfully rewarding & brilliantly entertaining book!!!<br>
                I shall treasure every moment of reading through this book series. Borrowing from Vasco’s ideas this can be a great topic for the study group or even an open university!<br>
                <br>
                Toby and Vasko, I shall try to pickup some of the patterns you have mentioned.<br>
                I shall take a bit of liberty to bring in new patterns that I think will interact in the given scenario. Here I am again bringing my own terminology-apologies and I shall first state my conventions : Any real life solution/situation I refer to as scene. My idea is such a solution will always emerge as an interaction between multiple patterns. Some of these patterns will be interrelated through a hierarchy while others will be quite independent of one another. Also same patterns may be related differently in different scenes. Focus is the cross between a pattern and a scene.<br>
                The numbering scheme is not achieving any thing except they show how a solution can be found through interaction and drilling through several patterns from more general to less general one until they come down to a focus that delivers a solution. So the numbering scheme will change depending on the scene considered. For my convenience I shall take my house as the current scene –just because I am more familiar with the scene. So the purpose of this exercise is to see whether this sort of scheme is acceptable or appealing to you-whether or not you think it will help to get to a solution.. This is directly derived from the current model I have of patterns and its software counterpart. .<br>
                Some of the patterns interacting at my house scene are:: Maintaining Life at every corner of the house” - a general pattern that will have a pattern "Life Style in South facing Houses" as a sub-pattern. Where as "Community Interaction with a house" is another pattern which is interacting with the first one but they are not directly linked through any hierarchy.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">This exercise will give us certain kind of focus that will be useful, amongst other things to see how ultimately different sections of the community can interact to bring up a solution. Mostly I am interested in the representation of patterns so that they can be part of normal business transactions. Also it gives some idea about the complexity of interaction of social structures like lawyers, councils and governments that is required.<br>

                Coming to the numbering I have got a few patterns to start: Mostly they are scattered but related-we need far more patterns to derive any solution. All the patterns listed are type 'S': they are not implementation related. [I shall have very little knowledge on the implementation front]. Some of you can extend this hierarchy as you get more ideas for implementation or otherwise.<br>
                The highest patterns are:<br>
                1. Maintaining Life at Every Corner of the house.<br>
                2. Community Interaction with the house.<br>
                3. Using geographic topology to bring harmony in house<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi All,<br>
                There has been lots of talking while I concentrating in another wave of activity on my building.<br>
                In answer to your question Vasko, I bought an old Mechanics Institute building in Boorowa last year. It has three sections, the first the hall and two side libraries and two rooms at the back of the hall, were built in 1883. The supper room constructed about 1910, which runs the full width of the hall at the back, and in 1930s, following its purchase by the CWA for the cost of the debts of the Mechanics Institute organisation, the kitchen and baby health centre was built on the back again, to the north. The back section is where I am living. The front and older section is in better condition than the rear, partly as the hall was built on massive rubble stone foundations and the new section was built in the depression with the accompanying cost cutting measures like no grip in the mortar.<br>
                It is interesting that more people who are interested in a non city life style do not come out to established country towns and snap up some of the marvelous buildings which are quietly falling to pieces and being demolished. All the materials are there, in our town at least, competent tradesmen, and the cost is small. I paid $75,000 for a 50 sq building in full brick on an acre of land with all services.<br>
                This might help in establishing the 'bottom up' grass roots level of change and perhaps be better than communities which "lock themeselves away" so to speak in more isolated communities. I am not knocking those communities, but I think there are some additional approaches.<br>
                I also have a community vegetable patch ready to go, and the reading rooms and library will be complemented by the bookshop, which hopefully will be able to sell local produce and products.<br>
                I could also host the conference on integration of patterns, and show people what country town living can offer. Mind you the town is not perfect! and council discussion is better left to a more secure email. I agree about the building of more unusual structures, they might get more acceptance if they are built in country town areas first, and establish their credibility, in mainstream building practices.<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi Tobby,</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Yes l agree, owner building can make you poor, atleast in the immediate future. But like a plant storing sunlight and nutrient for its future growth, you have probably gained and stored much intellectual capital that'll serve you and others well at different times in life from now.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l can understand what you are saying about beauracrats. l have also had some experience with them. l have found that often they take either of two positions, the path of least resistance, that you have mentioned, which often means giving you most resistance, particularly when you suggest something a little out of the ordinary. The other position they can take is where they put the onus on you to proove and substantiate your proposal, while they completely remove themselves from any responsibility or accountability. We often found this while working as eco-designers in Melbourne, building with earth brick and strawbales for example.<br>
                The building surveyors and other council beauracrats often took either of these two positions, maximum resistance or no resistance at all.<br>
                Both these positions have l believe one underlying agenda, or driving cause in common, that is the legal realms of litigation, ie; protecting oneself from litigation.<br>
                So, for council surveyors, engineers, beauracrats, their position is to try to make any innovation very difficult (simply because as you would know, innovation is experimentation, and experimentation can lead to failure or unexpected results) and if you can not do that then you absolve yourself from any responsibility and put all the responsibilty on the other, ie; often owner builders in the case of building.<br>
                If we kept talking about the whole dynamics here of litigation, responsiblity, public liability, protection of property, we would soon come to the insurance companies. This is where l believe much of what we are talking about has it's wellspring.<br>
                And beyond the wellspring, is the larger 'aquifer' which contains other things which also deserve attention. But most of us are probably in agreement that much of what is in this underlying 'aquifer' is many of the things we instinctively feel are things about Capitalism.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">We can keep this in mind. At the immediate moment however, l would like to hear more about your experiences in owner building. What was good about it, what was not so good, what patterns were useful, what weren't etc...<br>
                After building load bearing mudbrick, my partners and l, half jokingly and half seriously, decided to form a 'mudbrick workers liberation army'. Extremely labour intensive, as is strawbale building. We think that building with these materials is a lot more difficult than the fringe movements make out.<br>
                We also decided that building with these materials is more appropriate for cummunities who build together, and not so suitable for example for an isolated nuclear family building itself a house in the city. We feel this is even more so for strawbales. This is not to say that people should not use these materials.<br>
                <br>
                What is your feeling about mudbrick building?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">As for energy efficiency, l agree that the Energy rating programs are not very good.<br>
                But l am also not convinced yet about any claims of the need for sophisticated simulations and measurment of 'energy efficiency'.<br>
                These measurments can never deal with the subjective and human patterns of movement through buildings.<br>
                Why can't we instead work on our metabolism and biorythms to tune in to the weather better, as Georgina has pointed out?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l think the discussion with HT Odum would be extremely valuable, as also with permaculture and David Holmegren.<br>
                We can get good cross fertilization between and across disciplines if we did this, particularly if we joined other discussions which are more specifically relating social justice and community issues. These are often central to discussions of ecological justice, and in fact, they are really two sides of the same coin. Any culture which has not become so detached from nature, such as ours, would know this as a matter of coarse.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Dear Vasco, Pronob and others...<br>
                Great discussion, unfortunatly i've been off line for a while due to owner-builder induced poverty!<br>
                Reading through the previous mails has inspired me to make the following dubious claims...</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">To further the discussion re: why have some organisations dominated the buiding feild with their specific views?<br>
                I belive that beaurocrates will usually follow the path of least resistance, whilst guarding against whatever threatens their power. For example a Shire Engineer can do calculations on a required bridge, or use a premade propritety product that comes supplied with engineering comps and a garentee, you pick the path of least resistance! The threat to the engineer is the bridge failing. The product is garenteed, so the threat is dealt with. However this standardisation results in loss of flexability is design options, the engineers skill in designing for the local environment, and usuially a massive over use of materials.<br>
                Neither do most of us challenge publications because we were tought at school that truth come in book.<br>
                When the only truth come is a book we lose our oral traditions, why trust locals builders experiance when you can consult AS1684.4? Orally I have learned that old houses (perhaps Pronobs damp house in Sydney?) stayed dry by the ventilation caused by fires burning all year (cooking etc...) drawing a constant supply of air through the house. This is not in AS1684.4!<br>
                The beauty of the Pattern Language is that the generalsiations are general, ie every house built will interact with the sun. Patterns that are more climate appropriate are used in 'clumps' of patterns, or ignored. This is permaculture, it cannot be acheived prescritive legislation, or the NATHERS five star program. My passive solar mud brick house that has been mathmatically designed to require no suplementry heating does not rate as well as superinsulated box, that is electrcally heated. One of the foundations of permaculture is H.T.Odums general systems theory of ecology that attemps to compare apples with apples by relating all enery to its original sunlight value. Sound like i'm getting off track but bear with me. If my house<br>
                where heated with 10 mega joules of wood per year, the five star ideology would not differentiate between 10 mega joules of electrical energy. If both were expressed in their sunlight equivalents a massive difference becomes apparent. Think of the free work of nature. Wood; sunlight-clorofil-carbon storage-suger creation-wood. (this is all from memory so please don't quote!)Electricity; sunlight-clorofil-sugars-biomass-massive geological energy imputs-coal-large scale mining-burning (35% eff.)transmition (50% eff.). So the higher the energy quality the higher the initial energy quantity. Therefore 10 mega joules of wood energy takes the planet substancially less energy to create than 10 mega joules of electricall energy. There! you never thought you'd say low quality is good!<br>
                Back to the simplicity of patterns to control growth well. The Incan hill top cities were built with every building getting full solar acess, no building overshadows any other. Simple patterns with powerfull results.<br>
                Bill molisons permaculte book is a great read, but hard to apply. more recent publications from David Holmgren,and others are more refined.<br>
                Capitalism. I used to get really cross. More recently however I have been having some other thoughts. What if all political systems where languges. Languages that change when differednt patterns become, or cease to be, supportable. Perhaps capitalsim is a language of growth, or resource (read energy) dispersal. We have dispersed, in the last 100 years, an energy concentration that took the planet 400 million years to capture, concentrate and store from sunlight.<br>
                I've drawn a bit of a long bow with a few of these ideas, but I hope you have found them to be relevent to the exploration of pattern understanding.</font></p>

                You yourself pointed out earlier about your own house having its own constraints due to its given circumstances.<br>
                Georgina, you have also a house that is existing, presumably with its own problems, quite apart from the problems that council overlay on top of the existing ones.<br>
                This brings me to the issue l was interested before about owner builders. Owner builders are important in two ways, at least,</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">1) Often owner building is building from the 'bottom up'- this is where l believe any remnant, good patterns from different cultural pasts, are still living and implemented through 'owner building', (through part of the "builder based construction economy"- from Paul Reillys earlier comments)</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi guys,<br>
                Apologies for the delayed response. Been under the weather lately.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Georgina, capitalism has hijacked our world. It's also true that capitalism has spoiled the environment, starved 2/3 of the people on the planet, and for those of us who are not starving we are instead dying of boredom. It really isn't that good for us. l can see your point.<br>
                And l also agree that things should only and can only be changed from the bottom. l believe that patterns can contribute to the bottom up changing of the world.<br>
                But l also believe that it is possible for ideas like patterns to be co-opted or "commodified" and used to benefit those who have the time and leisure and means to make themselves the most beatiful surroundings, for themselves only, and put large walls and gates around themselves.<br>
                What of our past, and our ancestors, is useful to us? l suppose it varies from person to person and from culture to culture. But for me, l guess the sense of belonging and community is what l feel is the greatest loss from our past and ancestors that we don't have in modern society.<br>
                The internet can help to make new forms of communities but l'm not hopefull that the internet will be the saviour either, not alone anyway.<br>
                My most pessimistic response is that we won't balance capitalisms bad patterns with good patterns (because capitalism is more efficient at destroying than we are at building).<br>
                My most optimistic response to capitalism is that we will eternally live in boredom and mental illness if we did find a balance in it.<br>
                Georgina, l think that the issue you raise is a difficult one for patterns.<br>
                l suppose we just have to see what the "Nature of Order" says on Capitalism, history and the future.<br>
                In any case, l am keen to keep up this line of discussion.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">But l also agree with Pronob about staying focused.<br>
                And Pronob, here is another pattern for us to apply some numbering to. This is a pattern l have adapted from a Pattern language. It is "Half private garden" which l use in conjunction with "Minimum offset for houses from the street". This pattern is one that l have had some dramas with at councils with council town planners.<br>
                As council enforce the minimum offset from the street, l use the "Half private garden" at the front to make this zone useful. Usually the minimum offset rule leads to baron lawnscapes or de-facto car parks or car cemeteries in front of peoples houses. In most cases, the result is non living front yards. In a sense, space that has neither any public virtue or quality, nor any private use. Its like the Bermuda Triangle for automobiles.<br>
                The "half private garden" rescues this space l believe. It gives a good transition zone from the house to the street as well as allowing the household to interact with the street life and community in general. "Courtyards which live" can also be used in the same way.<br>
                But council have a problem with this, and l think it is largely cultural bias. They think that spaces can either be private or public. Half private is just a bit wierd. Why would you want to have something that is half private? What is half private? Is it private or not private? they ask.<br>
                And besides, if it is meant to be private, then they can not count it in the overall requirements of provision of private open space for dwellings. So, l have kept working away at different councils. l have found ways of getting some to accept the validity of such a pattern.<br>
                But this pattern is useful in another sense. It allows a designer, on most sites, to have both at least private north facing living areas and otional south facing living areas, which l would argue are important for our climate. This is important also from the point that most subdivisions are not ideally oriented for good solar aspect. In other words it extends the design possibilities by broadening the context and design response parameters, if this makes sense.<br>
                Pronob, how would you go about recording or numbering here? Please comment.</font></p>

                My opinion of building codes, engineering, materials etc is that, along with lots of others things in our world, housing has been hijacked by capitalism. It seems that the only way to make a change, by 'patterns' or anything else, is to make changes ourselves, and spread the 'pattern' from the bottom up. Things to include would be choice of where we live, climate, aspect, location; and how we live, in concrete boxes which are economical to build and realise maximum return for the builder, or in human- friendly places where we can reach our full potential as people.<br>
                My thought is that the further we get from our ancestors, in our style of living the less happy we will be.<br>
                For example, I think we need contact with the seasons, with changing weather, even proper divisions between night and day. We need open spaces, and things that are green, and fresh water. One of our problems is that technology has moved too fast, and the brain has not had enough time, like probably thousands of years, to accommodate change.<br>
                Perhaps it is enough to return some 'ancient' things to our modern lives. Sunny rooms, climate variation, fresh grown food, while still keeping the commodities of society. Is it a matter of balancing patterns of society, of building, of commodification, of accepting some and modifying or rejecting others.<br>
                What do you think?<br>

                Vasko,<br>
                Spontaneity- given the word is almost synonimous to 'natural' is very important in a discussion around patterns. So I fully agree with you that a parallel stream of discussion which talks to build methods and desciplines will help keep the discussions more lively. I must also confess that my interest in numbering the patterns as suggested before originates from my desire to represent and manipulate patterns through software tools. Without any such tools such numbering effort will very sson loose spontaneity. So I shall suggest doing that exercise for a few interacting patterns only -this ,hopefully, will encourage a descipline which helps in dealing with general and less general solution patterns, abstract patterns and how they relate and interact to real cases of construction, design and renovations. To start I would like to listen to more real life design/renovation patterns which practising professionals like yourself,Georgina and others can find in old and new structures.</font>

These issues l feel are important to pattern languages and a diaogue can be had between these issues and building codes stuff. l think there are important connections in all this stuff that l am trying to understand.

                Sorry for my delayed response. I am in the process of changing my work base,so I donot have always the tools at hand to write to the discussion. By the way,thanks for the suggestions to improve the living conditions at my house. Like any other house mine has also it unique characterstics- like firstly it is on a slope -it is below the street level in an geographical area which is full of mountains and hills. This in part contributes to limited sunlight to majority of rooms in the house.<br>
                Coming to a different topic, I was bit suprised by the limited response into this discussion site.So I thought more discussions based on concrete patterns will attract more partcipants. So why don't you bring up exact pattern examples like the one you mentioned a few responses back - about the front of houses -may be we can follow a sequential numbering convention that will help us to refer those patterns in the discussions and help us to bring some context and order into it as they grow to cover more and more issues. I feel talks about patterns should always start from a specific physical structure some where on this planet. This is very important to bring the interaction between different patterns. Patterns will have higher levels or lower levels of abstraction but the ultimate focus of that should be to improve or make more humane, more 'natural' some thing or some structure on this planet. So starting from a specific physical instance of a structure -whether in the guide books or in an actual physical buildings or artifacts will help us to retain this focus . If you are comfortable we can follow a '.' convention to go from general to more specific e.g '1' for the most general 'front set back for houses' ; and 1.1 to 'giving a sense of private world through the front setup' ,then 1.1.1 to 'garden between street and house' etc where as 1.2 can be another kind of focus like 'safety of your house in a busy street'. It will be good if we can distinguish the pattern arising from such subjective issues from patterns created in terms of physical features,constrain and practises like 'minimum width of the front yard' or the height of the chimney etc. It is understandable such physical characterstics will be the cause and constrains of other physical features like 'minimum area of the plot for a apartment block' etc; so conceivably such physical characterstics and their dependencies will very much emerge as some patterns-I suspect these will have lots of technical jargons and engineering guidelines and principles . But it will be worth while if from the begining we keep such patterns arising from physical constrains as seperate from more subjective patterns which a layman can relate to . We can follow a convention where the last dot is followed by S[subjective] or a P[physical/practising].Eg the pattern "front set back for houses' can become 1.S, where as a pattern like 'measurements for an apartment block' can be given a number 2.P etc; it is quite possible that a subjective patterns will spawn or refer to a more physical/practising pattern and vice versa. It might sound complicated - I welcome your opinion and criticisim and suggestions. Also -I hardly know about 'premaculture patterns' -can you please suggest a few patterns that will bring the concepts,beliefs and practices of premaculture alive?<br>

                l might have mentioned earlier that l reckon l have a pattern to compliment north facing areas, and that is shady areas on the south. This can also be a flywire enclosed room on the south, with ferns and stones and water. It can be used to cool your home in summer. The sunny areas on the north can have high windows which open from the bottom downwards and the shady south edge of the house can have low windows which open from the top and outwards into the shady room.<br>
                l think passive cooling in our climate is possible. l have not seen its full potential developed in any particular areas in Australia. It seems to me that for Australias climate, it would have had just as much attention as passive heating has had in energy efficient architecture.<br>
                So south facing rooms are not necessarily a bad thing in a Cool Temperate climate like Melbourne, and probably much of Sydney, although l think Sydney is a bit more humid isn't it?<br>
                As you point out though, your place has the south facing areas but not the north facing ones. Maybe you can use some skylights or skytubes to get some sunlight from the north and east sky into the south parts of the building.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Yes a lively democratic society would be nice. Patterns could definitely contribute to a healthy debate, atleast to the topic of building codes if not to more important things like social equity and ecological justice.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi,<br>
                I can appreciate the pattern Vasko mentions about 'North facing houses' even without having any architectural background. I have got a south facing house with an attractive backyard but a house which is damp ridden. The room with most damp is the one with no north opening and with limited sun light aswell.<br>
                The question Vasko raises about why any published material right or wrong gets a strong hold in our practices is interesting to me, coming from information and computer science background. You can see how the spread of the internet has made the share market more volatile as well as more popular and open to ordinary people. Thus accessibilty of a facilty to ordinary people changes the nature and role of the facility itself. I believe accessibility of Patterns will make standards and guidelines more open to discussions amongst not only people who are trained to do that but also amongst the end-users and customers. This will ultimately make it difficult for people with vested immediate interest to dominate the standards and building codes. This is not only true for architecture profession but also others like medical, law etc.<br>
                So rant or not, the question of representation of Patterns and their accessibilty in ordinary transactions is worth while from the point of view of doing a fundamental change in the society. This change is only part of a change that is essential to a lively democratic society.</font>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hey its cool, the site belongs to us all. I'm glad you've visited us.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l totally agree that the large timber/forestry, concrete and engineering bodies have absolutely dominated building culture, they have heavily influenced building codes and design, (not to mention what insurance companies have done also). The building codes and the 'design patterns' imposed by these large private and public bodies have totally colonised the patterns which traditionally were used collectively by our communities.<br>
                But in the first place they have succeeded in doing this by destroying communities, (and an example in building is how the rights of the owner builder has been eroded over the decades since the 50's, this offensive is continued now against the owner builder by the banks for example).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Apoligies for the rant, you're right, we can cut the crap if we got straight to permaculture.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Without belitlleing your efforts out at Fryers Forest, (l appreciate the difficulties you must have had trying to form a community out there with radical ideas for living ecologically and collectively, l hate to think what your council was like) but my difficulty is that l have to work day in and day out with these building codes and design guidelines. l am on a daily basis having to contend with them, dissect them to find their merit and challenge them with better patterns like permaculture and Christopher Alexanders patterns.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">To pick up a specific point of yours that "Bad patterns can be made existant simply by published biased data, rather than relying on the knowledge that our cultures contain",<br>
                It's absolutely right what you're saying. That's all it takes really. And the published word then becomes gospel.<br>
                But why? Why does the published biased data have such persistance and ability to permeate into peoples consciousness, especially when it's not true?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">There is an ecological pattern that is at present under threat (amongst all the rest that are under threat). It is the pattern of "North facing outdoors" or, "Living areas to the north".<br>
                Henley Homes, which is a large Building company in Melbourne, now claim that they can build a five star energy rated home. This five star home is a response by Henley to Legislation which soon may be introduced in Victoria for all new homes to have a minimum of 4 stars.<br>
                Well, when l heard, l thought, that's good, the big players are forced to respond in a responsible way in these times of impending ecological disaster. l later found out however that Henley can get five star ratings simply by enveloping their houses in very high insulation, icluding aluminium throughout the walls while they even faced their houses west or even south.<br>
                Tricky buggers aren't they. They've used bad patterns to replace good patterns. And the clients are happy cause they have an environmentally friendly home.<br>
                When l first bagan designing homes to face the sun, my clients, who were mostly from southern european climates, were really not that keen. They wanted me to design shady areas on the south for them. Melbourne's winter was mild for them but Melbourne's summer was unbearable, particularly the sun, as they were accustomed to much colder winters and milder summers.<br>
                So these clients, who are often the same clients that Henley now build homes for, don't mind that their homes are facing south, but they do like the fact that their home is going to use less energy and be cheaper to run.<br>
                What is not often in the equation though is how healthy these homes are either, but people are cottoning on to this also now, as most of these southern european people are dying of cancer and they can't drink red wine cause the doctor has given them tablets to drink instead, often for diabetes and blood pressure. Increasingly they're asking how come so many of us are taking tablets.<br>
                There's a joke going around in the Macedonian community, one friend says to another;<br>
                Would you like a drink?<br>
                No, l'm on talblets!<br>
                Anyway, that aside, it would be good to visit Fryers forest sometime, l have visited a couple of times, but many years ago. Might see you there sometime.</font></p>

                I'm interested in Vasko's thoughts of the origins of good and bad patterns.<br>
                A schcism has developed between oraly transmitted language and knowledge and engineered products. A good example of this is Slaked lime render. Everybody used this up to the 1930's until concrete manufacturers spent $$ getting engineering spec's published for their product. Architects etc... were able to look up a table and specify a material without having to understand the material. Many old buildings that were one rendered in breathable lime are know<br>
                dying of damp under cement render. Who wrote the australian timber building code AS1684.4? The first draught was written by the Pine Promotion Council, with standards Australia using the PPC's basic assumtions for updates of the code. Bad patterns can be made existant simply by publish biased data, rather than relying on the knowledge that our cultures contain.<br>
                Enough of a rant about the building codes and pattern formulation, for ecological pattern understanding we have permaculture. A new book on permaculture (another great aussie invention!)is about to be published,http://www.spacountry.net.au/holmgren/Pub.html#PC Principles</font>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi Pronob,</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">To me your proposal that everyone should develop personally, in their knowledge and skills and still lead a normal happy life in society does not sound idealistic. Infact l would go further and say that if we don't develop personally in our knowledge and skills, then we won't live happy lives in society.<br>
                l have been trying to collect my thoughts about patterns and building codes over the last couple of days.<br>
                There are a number of angles from which to approach the subject, all equally complex and difficult.<br>
                l am most interested in the social and cultural aspects of our building codes and design guidelines. That is, how do building codes reflect the culture and social setup that we live in, and how do they help in turn to support that structure which gives rise to them.<br>
                In this sense codes and guidelines are a type of patterns for the society that we live in, except that most of them are bad patterns.<br>
                l am interested in where these bad patterns come from. On the other hand l am also interested in where the good patterns come from.<br>
                For example there is a building code and design guideline in the new Residential Code of Victoria which says that, for new houses or multiple houses on a site the set back of the new house from the frontage should be the average of the two houses on either side of it or 9m, whichever is the lesser. This is l believe a sort of pattern. It gives a context and a solution. How did this guideline come into being?<br>
                Because in a neighbourhood where front setbacks are uniform and frontyards are baron lawnscapes, or parking lots, that is, dead spaces, what is the real meaning of this guideline? In other words, does this guideline have cultural roots or purely technical and engineering origins concerned with infrastructure.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The other side of building codes and design guidelines is the technical side. The side that engineers, surveyors, councils and town planners are involved in.<br>
                What is the role of these professionals in the rules, apart from administering and enforcing the rules. Also, what is there background and interpretation of guidelines.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The other side is the professinals like myself who use the rules to design the built environment for others to live in.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l suppose the subject is even more complex when we realise that there are connections between the social, cultural, technical and administrative sides in their effect on how building codes and design guidelines take their shape.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">History keeps coming to my mind throughout all of these subjects.<br>
                When did this or that code come into place for example, why did it come into place, what were the particular historical context for its emergence?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So Pronob, l will ask for your feedback at this stage. Are any of these issues of particular interest to you for discussion?<br>
                l suppose there are at least two ways to approach the discussion from here. We can keep talking in general terms until we focus on the particular, or we can start with the particular and expand into the general.</font></p>

                Although my original expectation were I would get people interested in other deciplines who would join in, that did not happen. At the momment I am tryig to get some academic institutes like ADFA in Canberra to recognise Pattern Based Computing as one of their recognised courses or even organise seminars on this topic for computer professionals . If I succeed doing that in the next few months you may find some students joining the discussion and hopefully,also giving a bit of time towards developing codes in the open source environment offered by SourceFotge. In the mean time your suggestion to get on to the discussion on how patterns can be used to uplift the quality of older design guidelines and building codes sounds something worthwhile. In fact that is the only way we can slowly introduce patterns in general discourse and reality. So please feel free to articulate your ideas in that area.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I donot know about history of Pattern use in Australia, or for that matter anywhere else. Again a narration of that sort will help to through some insight into how patterns become a determining factor in good designs.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I tend to think any thing we create in reallife,the patterns play their role -only thing is they remain hidden in daily life and popular culture. After all it needs some readiness from the individuals to appreciate patterns. However, those who can see its value ,it is their responsibility to first of all make it accessible to others in all sorts of circumstances in the reallife. Some may think up tools to make it happen- to express patterns and do transactions based on patterns-that will slowly make patterns part of normal way of life. Overall value in that is it allows each of us to evolve in knowledge and skills and still lead a normal happy life in the society. Does it sound too idealistic?<br>

                l have woken many times to find the world much as it was before. My spirits have not really dampened knowing what you are saying about the position of marginalised ideas like patterns in such industries as computers, for it is the same in building and architecture for patterns.<br>
                Have you heard of that saying,<br>
                " The lie travels around the world before the truth can put its boots on"<br>
                It's a bit like that for patterns, and indeed for most other truths and good ideas. Unfortunately, postmodernism and modernism, l think, have spread the lies much better and faster than patterns have managed to get into the vocabulary of popular culture.<br>
                It's an interesting thing that. Why have patterns not gained currency in our culture?<br>
                You say that patterns are marginalised in computers, but from my end it appears that patterns are even more marginalised in building and architecture.<br>
                It's probably a future topic on its own. l would like to find out when patterns were first used in Australia. Do you know?</font></p>

                As a designer in private architecture firm l use building codes and design guidelines on a daily basis. Some codes and guidelines are good and many are bad.<br>
                l would like to discuss how patterns can be used when bad codes and guidelines often undermine this attempt.<br>
                Did you develop any opinion about this through your own project of the renovation of your own home?<br>
                l have gained some analysis of it through my work and l want to try and articulate this analysis because l feel it is very important to the future of patterns.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Good Day Vasko,</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Yes, you are right about how end user requirement drives software reuse and maintenance, but the point I was making about design re-use is more fundamental in the way we design software solutions. In the traditional way of software development ,the software maker gets the software working and then writes a user manual -which instructs the potential users about how to do specific things like [in case of the word-processor] copying a phrase ,pasting at the end of the paragraph etc .<br>
                But effectively there is a much more complex transaction going on in the background.<br>
                What the software maker is doing is slowly bringing the user to the world [in terms of software] he/she has designed.<br>
                I suppose the same thing happens in any other kind of design. For example the automobile design -the way the gear ,clutch, accelerator combination work is part of the design of the car-it is just that it has become such a widely accepted standard that it has become a pattern-taken-for granted.<br>
                However in a software package the functions required and their associated techniques are so numerous that it is<br>
                not possible to work around any such established pattern. Other fact is of course the software packages are also being constantly invented and constantly evolving.<br>
                We can say by learning to use a software package the user is introduced to the world designed by the<br>
                software maker.I am describing reuse of design from this perspective-reused by the user. As the user becomes more and more expert in the package<br>
                the user gets more and more inside the world designed by the software designer.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman"><br>
                You can see this more vividly in the real world when the university graduates become the executives in the<br>
                commercial world they choose the package [-be that be operating system or the database-] that is more familiar to them.<br>
                No wonder the software companies are willing to make generous contributions to the education institutions in terms of software and hardware.<br>
                It is quite possible to design a software package that does lots of things. But how can you pre-define everything? It is not a healthy practice to try to design every thing for the user. It is far better practice to design something so the user requirement can evolve while the user lives a his/ her normal life. Assuming this is good practice ,it is far better if the user requirement can be allowed to evolve in a world<br>
                which drives the user rather than through the software package someone designed to do some specific task.<br>
                This is what pattern based software design and content based computing is focussing on.<br>
                For example a mechanical designer should be able to specify and evolve with his/ her requirement in the mechanical design world.For example he might say "..,now that I can<br>
                draw the train track and the train, I want to show the amount of friction that is generated as the train moves faster..."</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman"><br>
                On the question of why the code does not contain the design- you might guess this has been a problem through out our computing history.<br>
                We have tried to fix it through elaborate documentation or even smart tools /packages. The fact is documentation in isolation of the code and the object code [generated from the<br>
                code] become useless for two reasons. Documentation in isolation cannot establish the right context for execution of the code and<br>
                also the code can be changed easily without changing the documentation at all [in real life this happens very often]. Content based computing is built on the premise that computation progresses in the same fashion that a human being understands the system. This ensures the code is a replica of a content that human being<br>
                understands in the specific context. You are right on the point in suggesting .....content based computing can store design knowledge of the architecture<br>
                or the particular structures..<br>
                Of course this kind of solution brings in other issues like intellectual property , security rights and also performance issues to the front.Each of these issues is a seperate dimension to the software design challenge. The solution to these issues is not to design something half or restrict the dimensions of growth but to allow it to grow full in all the dimensions.<br>
                Traditional computing is based on the Van-Neuman model where input- process -output defines the scope and result of computation. In contrast, pattern-based computing pattern tour determines the context. The pattern tour provides a path similar to human understanding<br>
                while the interaction of different patterns within a scene provides the dynamics of computation.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Why Microsoft is not doing it? There is certainly business interest to build new ones which can be built only as the extension of the old ones - however,I do not believe that is the only reason why things like pattern based computing has not found its root in the academic and commercial world.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">One reason is not enough people know about it. The other reason, the architects of the new industry is too busy fighting the old fires. I sent some write up to a person quite well known in the computing world who had also his interest in Patterns. By the way, interest in Patterns has been with software community for the last 10-12 years.<br>
                But he has returned my writing to me saying he is too busy with his other projects to pass any judgment on something that is deep enough to propose a new way of computing.<br>
                Pattern based computing, if it can take root in the mainstream computing will not only benefit the software community but it shall provide a kind of meta-grammer on which other professional and<br>
                literary disciplines can build their own patterns and transact through patterns.<br>
                That is all for now. I hope I have not dampened your interest in Pattern based computing by suggesting this is something foreign to the mainstream software world.</font></p>

                Are you saying that software reuse and maintenance is driven partly by the end user requirements for programs to have multiple abilities?<br>
                And that marketing and distribution package software basically to specialise in certain things with the pretext of providing diversity to users?<br>
                Why does someone not make a program that can do everything? Draw pictures, write words, calculate sums, design buildings, make photos, publish books etc...<br>
                But l still do not quite understand why this is called reuse or maintenance of design rather than design development?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">When you say that coding does not hold the design knowledge this makes sense.<br>

                Also has this anything to do with patenting at all, and the privatisation of intelectuall, social knowledge?<br>
                How is computing different between pattern computing and conventional computing?<br>
                Does the fact that people like Microsoft have the shear power of mega, mega computing ability over everyone else set the stage for how computing is done?</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hello Vasko,<br>
                Firstly reuse and maintenance of software design is in the nature of the current software technology and how it fits into our normal life. Any piece of software of course have some requirement to start with. But<br>
                very often we find that as soon as we have developed the software the requirement changes or<br>
                we get additional requirements.<br>
                You may not realize it with a common piece of software like the<br>
                word-processor -that is because<br>
                the way we are tied up with the distribution and marketing of it.Just to<br>
                give an example ,suppose you need a word processor to give to your grandmother who will like to use it<br>
                to write periodic simple letters and poetry for her grand-children.To start she was interested in writing words-she wont need<br>
                'online collaboration' or 'auto summary' or 'thesaurus'-and other numerous features that come with the word processor -<br>
                slowly she became interested not only in writing words but also in painting pictures -the software should have unfolded<br>
                such things quite naturally bringing in features as she wanted, For this to happen, she would not have to show special smartness<br>
                towards the computer tasks -she should have picked the necessary skills as easily as she writes two rhyming sentences.<br>
                But this does not happen in real life. One is considered to be extra-smart just because one is able to use a package what Microsoft has developed<br>
                after spending billions in usability testing labs. This can be interpreted as a reuse of design-where the product design is supposed to unfold to the end-user easily. But of course with the current sate of affairs that does not happen.The design reuse that is called for here is a quality in the overall design of the whole word processor so that the design of little pieces [like drawing pictures] becomes apparent<br>
                to the user of those pieces easily just by coming to the specific context.Thus in the example when grand mother<br>
                is ready to draw pictures she commands draw picture when the word processor<br>
                knows a topical line in the letter and brings drawing matching the topic or suggests related topics through matching with patterns matching rest of the content 'keywords' in the letter.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">There is another design reuse-related to maintenance-the situation is frequent in a commercial world ,where to change a designed software<br>
                which e.g. does some smart calculation to measure the performance of bank employees, one has to know the business rules that prompted the design<br>
                and its associated calculations -but the person who had done that originally had gone somewhere else taking with him the ability of the software<br>
                to evolve with the changing business world for the bank. The new person assigned to do the design changes takes longer time in changing the design. Because the code of the software does not hold the design knowledge, it is quite easy for the new person to exceed the original<br>
                design effort in an effort to find out and reuse the original design to bring in the desired changes.<br>
                I believe the solution of these problems can be built into the software architecture by building a new model of computation based in pattern-based computing.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Having said this much I am also interested in hearing from other members in patternlanguage.com who<br>
                might have computing background-this is specially because if I have to talk about specific role of patterns as I see, it would be a biased view towards my own way of representation of patterns. We shall speak about that in due course.Thanks</font></p>

                As far as architecture or building is concerned, l suppose what your comment about 'reuse' alludes to for me is a number of things, and l would like to pursue the notion so l can put my finger on precisely what is in that notion, and what gives connection to software and architecute in relation to patterns.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In architecture is reuse just the literal meaning that patterns can be reused time and time again in varying contexts, that they have historical validity and that they carry the analysis of the problem and the solution to the problem simultaneously?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l find it interesting to hear that software maintenance costs more than software design and development? Why? And why are you intrested in this maintenance or reuse?</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So what do l know about this?<br>
                I can understand how patterns help me to build things, and l can understand how they in part give the context of the solution and in part are the solution for that context.<br>
                But how do patterns relate to prior givens, or to the broader context from which they emerge?<br>
                If my example of timber, slate, concrete floor is a product of a number of patterns happening, how do l retrieve those patterns from that process and test their validity or usefulness?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">How are patterns generated? How do they get their validity? How do they get their place in history?</font></p>

                My interest in Patterns is from the point of view of reuse of design. However, at the same time I am interested in giving patterns some kind of expression that shall help us better maintain or reuse an existing design. I am not sure how much<br>
                of this design reuse or maintenance aspect come into play in Architecture but it is certainly a major issue in the software field where in general software maintenance cost more than software design and development.<br>
                Starting from the example you provided:the pattern of timber,slate and concrete floor, first thing I shall<br>
                suggest that this is not a pattern, but an application of a pattern. After looking at this example,some one can do a floor sketch for a library room with book shelves along the four walls and some display item in the middle. The wooden part of the floor is layed parallel to the four walls,idea is people,without shoes, will stand mostly next to the book shelves when they are in this room.The library room still implements the pattern that you suggested. But what can be the description of the pattern you suggested? Before I put my suggestion about that, I like to draw your attention to the fact that I have got my own definition of patterns which I have also used in my site papers and other softwares. In my model, pattern is nothing but a consequtive sequence of the focus of the mind. A collection of several related focus is called a Scene. In reality a Scene can be a free flowing description of the solution as you presented. A description like that in general has several patterns flowing through it.<br>
                Coming back to the example you provided, I can suggest several patterns[my brand of patterns] flowing through it.<br>
                e.g "Comfortable Floors For Solar House" is one, others can be "Maintaining thermal mass in a solar House", "location of Solar rooms in temperate climate" etc.<br>
                My point is all these patterns exist simultaneously in your particular example.It may appear that these descriptions of patterns are focussing on the problem rather than the solution like a more accepted version of pattern does. But I have no problem with that -I can easily call the patterns like "Floor with , timber, concrete ", "Wooden Floor for thermal retention" ,"North Face for Solar room" etc.<br>
                My point is, it is essential to give Patterns a "standard 'normalised' form" with simplicity of concept.<br>
                If we accept the above approach, the pattern "Comfortable Floors For Solar House" can be thought of as a narrative with consequtive sections on various aspects of the title of the pattern. For example there can be section on the comfort aspect of the floor, concentrating on relation between floor material and blood flow through the feet. There can be a section on materials possible for floors. Point to note none of these sections will have only the single pattern in question. Each section will have other numerous patterns flowing through it just like your example does. What I am saying is,<br>
                Patterns can be compared with strings of multilayered beads hanging together from the neck. A pattern can be thought of as a string going through large beads where each bead has a number of thread penetrable wholes. Each string passes throgh some selective beads but all together the beads hang from the neck of the wearer as if stuck on a single wide band around the neck.<br>
                Vasko, if you are happy with this simplification of patterns I can go on discussing other aspects of patterns -of how we can use them through<br>
                software tools to aid in architecture work in dynamic design environment [patterns are not static design aspect any more,they would define the action at almost every little design step]. Here I shall wait for your thought before I proceed further.<br>
                Thanks<br></font>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">For example, l think l have discovered, or rediscovered some patterns in my work.<br>
                They are:</font></p>

                Flywire enclosure<br>
                Shady area on the south<br>
                and l have a pattern for a timber, slate and concrete floor.<br>
                These three materials can be combined together to make a floor that looks beautiful and gives you good thermal mass.<br>
                You can make a floor like this for a passive solar house, it is probably best to make this floor in the north facing rooms that get best sunlight. In the past passive solar buildings used concrete slabs to get thermal mass for the building for both winter heat storage and also for summer heat absorption, thereby having a moderating effect on the internal temperatures.<br>
                But concrete slabs can also be cold in winter and hard and not very comfortable to walk on.<br>
                So l drew a sketch of a floor that had a band of polished cocrete around the room, roughly about 600mm wide, sometimes it can be a metre, depending on the size of the room. Then you have a row of green slate tiles inside this, about 250mm for their width, and within the green slate tiles you have a recycled redgum or jarrah floor recessed into the slab and flush with the tiles or concrete.<br>
                This way you get the best of all worlds. You get the thermal mass that for your building and where you sit mostly, you have a timber floor that is warmer and easier on your feet than concrete.<br>
                l made this pattern after l built my first loadbearing mudbrick house. This is when l realised how difficult it was building with mudbridks.</font></p>

              <blockquote>
                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Vasko,<br>
                Thanks for your last two responses.<br>
                I shall start with a brief background where I am coming from. Although my interest in Patterns has been through my interest in Software Architecture, it is something else which attracted me to Software Architecture in the first place.<br>
                That something else includes an knack towards observation of the process of human understanding [if there is any process at all].<br>
                In this domain I believe patterns have a major role to play. After carefull consideration of what goes on in different computational activity, I strongly believe the only<br>
                way we can take leverage of this ever-present 'Patterns' is by building all our computational tools like software programs on a different kind of computational platform which I called Content based computing. If you have a spare time you are most welcome to read a paper I wrote on this -it is in my site-the address of which appears below.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Your narration of a practicing architect's encounter with Patterns and other human beings has to some extent supports my belief about Patterns. Patterns,I believe can be and should be<br>
                made part of the language between the architects and as well as between the architects and their clients.<br>
                Expression of patterns has to be something which we understand just by knowing english -one need not be trained in any particular discipline to understand patterns. For example "going to school" can be a pattern. Also patterns can be nested e.g. 'going to school' can have another pattern built into :'catching the transport'.This may sound like I am trivialising patterns by ignoring such pre-requisites like context,problem,forces of nature etc.<br>
                But we need some formal framework to represent every pattern in a way that patterns are just not documentation of good practices but patterns become the drivers of design in the tool sense as well. However that does not mean patterns loose their subjective gravity. All it means is patterns become the vehicle of transactions between people in the society, between professionals.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Coming back to the architect's service ,imagine we have a standard convention where we describe a structure by a short expression of the very human activity that goes on<br>
                in and around that structure. Imagine there is a world-wide standards data base of such expressions-something similar to domain names for internet addresses. Against the short description,in this case, the data base has some graphical description of the pattern of that structure it is referring to.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">For example we can describe two garden styles:<br>
                one is "Indian Puja Garden" and the other is "Japanese Tea".<br>
                Now these two structure for gardens expresses certain combination of facilities ,like a group of people to<br>
                do some ceremony or practice, the first being where a group of 10-15 people sit together on aplatform and a priest sit on an elevated level.<br>
                The tea garden is more for a group of 5 couples where each couple has a separate place to sit.<br>
                Both those styles of garden might include [nested] a pattern like "free-flowing fresh air". With easy access and representation of such patterns and their graphical views , Patterns will become more part of the transactions not only between architects but also between architects and clients. Without my background in architecture these examples are quite superficially made up. But I suppose you can get the idea of what sort of role for patterns I am thinking of. It may appear this is a long way from the state today-but in the internet age no one really knows the speed of rush to the future.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l would like to try and answer your last question from your most recent entry;<br>
                How can patterns help improve architec services?<br>
                l am trying to answer this for my own sake, because l am also trying to understand the answer to the question.<br>
                l work for a private architecture firm and have been trying to introduce the patterns into the services of our firm.<br>
                So far l have had more luck with the clients than with the directors.<br>
                In my mind your question has two parts to it, at least.<br>
                The first part can be answered directly to the question, and this is much easier for me to answer.<br>
                Patterns can help architect services in many ways. One of the most important ways they can help is that they provide a common language between the architect and client, as well as to any other people involved in a particular building project like the builders and tradespeople.<br>
                Patterns can help the architect specifically by unravelling to the architect the organic nature between built structures and the way humans inhabit space and time in their myriad of actions from the most mundane to the most profound.<br>
                Patterns in this sense give human actions quite a primary role as determining influences in the way buildings and human habitations take their shape.<br>
                Today however, architects begin design the other way around. They start with a 'bright' idea, often this is a form, a shape, a geometry of some sort, then they squeeze the living actions of people into the those particular spaces.<br>
                According to patterns this is just not the way things happen, they have never happened this way for humans in the past.<br>
                The other side of your question for me is why have patterns not been embraced or used more widely by architects and other design and building professionals?<br>
                l have only known about patterns for a short time myself.<br>
                l handed one of the patterns books to my director who is in his 50's and was around at the time when patterns were emerging in the USA. He had not heard of patterns but was quite enthuasiastic and inquisitive about them and wanted to have a look.<br>
                He flicked through the pages , and have you ever seen someone throw a dog a handfull of rabbits guts, how it lunges eagerly at them initially, and then realising after having half swallowed a mouthfull, that it does not really like the taste, then recoils and backs away, growling and convulsing as it shakes the contents right back out. Well this is what my director was like. And like the tempted and curious dog,skirting around afterwards and nipping at and licking at the what it had just expelled, so too my director skirted around the book and ate one page here and one page there, but not the whole lot.<br>
                l suppose it had that raw, human, fleshy taste to him. Too strong. He later described it as too 'deep'.<br>
                l am still trying to still understand what he did not like about the patterns.<br>
                Our firm is a medium sized firm, with building consultants and architects and surveyors all working together. Most of the blokes, particularly the directors are suspicious of most things, particularly these pattern things.<br>
                The women on the other hand, who are mostly in secreterial and admin. roles think that it's all fine and in fact quite important.<br>
                The clients who l have been giving the patterns to, want patterns with cream on top.<br>
                And then there are the cleaners who come in at the end of every day to clean our crap and cups and food everywhere. They hardly speak a word of english but understand these patterns. They reckon that;<br>
                "Yeah, ofcoarse you have to plant fruit trees and vegetables in your backyard, these patterns of yours are nothing new, we know them already, our parents have been doing it like that for a long time you know".<br>
                So now my clients are asking for more patterns, and the directors are seeing these clients eating these 'rabbits guts' and their eyes bulge and water and their cheeks puff up and glow... cause its all a bit hard for them.<br>
                l keep telling them we can improve our services with these patterns. And they're not that stupid that they can't see cause they really are quite canny and shrewd.<br>
                My best understanding of why they don't like the patterns at the moment is based on superficial appearances of their behaviour. They're trying to work out if these patterns are going to be a staple diet in the future, and should they start learning how to eat them?</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Reading the comments so far I guess every one has been interested in pattern from aechitecture-related perspective. My experience with arcitecture has been as an user of services from architects, and that too is not terribly positive one-I spent around $10,000 on some architectural plans for the renovation of the house I live in. The architects produced about 5 sketches starting from initial sketch to developed plans and because I had to postpone the project because of personal circumstances I just ended up paying the prorata on the completed task, the total architecture cost being 9% of the estimated budget of the project. This may have been far more interactive and suggestive phase of the potential of the place I live in, had the architects approached the issue from a different perspective. To start,they might have suggested a few alternate ways I can set up my back yard.Like how it can add value not only to my property but also adds some attraction to the neighbourhood.They could have made some alternative sketches about the way we can use our swimming pool-not only just for swimming but also as a calming agent for us and our tenanats who live next door-or how we can have alternative entertainment area for sitting under the tree or next to swimming pool etc.Instead the architects interest was totally focussed on two things-one is our buget and the other was what we ourselves want. The fact is budget is to some extent related to the potential of the building structure and ourselves, not being architects, not necessarily know what is possible given the position of our land and neighbourhood.<br>
                This is where patterns may come handy-if the architects were follower of patterns it would have been quite possible for them to give us some possible alternatives without charging $10,000. I guess same thing is happening at other places as well where people are building some thing because that would presumably fetch highest financial return or it is the cheapest to build. In this rush other issues and mental preferences does not get much chance to play.<br>
                I am a software pwerson by profession. I can probably imagine systems holding information on patterns -but will like to hear the point of view of practising architects -how do you think pattern can enhance the architecture service in general? Can it be used to protray a possible lifestyle the future structure will help to bring in?</font>

                Never used a chatroom before so here goes.<br>
                Fascinating book..quite prescriptive telling us how to design window frames! Pattern Language has been around for so long. It must be a very quite revolution because you never hear of it. I was introduced to it by Warrick Rowell down at Rosneath Farm in Dunsborough, WA. Warrick is a real fanatic about it and is designing the whole built environment on pattern language principles.<br>
                As an architect, I am keen to explore the concept of "humanising spaces". Delivering such an outcome through our builder-based construction economy though seems to be a major obstacle.</font>

                My main interest with patterns have been on the representation of patterns and in making them part of our lifestyle rather than keeping them a subjective and abstract entity. Surely in that approach we have to be cautious -we should make sure patterns do not become a syntax for writing a piece of software-rather our main focus should be how we can make it easier for people in different walks of life to follow patterns to enhance their life, education,understanding of the nature of things.</font>
