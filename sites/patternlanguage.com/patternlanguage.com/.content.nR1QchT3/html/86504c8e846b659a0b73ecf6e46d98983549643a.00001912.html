              <font color="brown">PART 3 -- A NEW DEFINITION OF NATURE</font>
            </center>
            <p><font color="brown">If I am right, then the unfolded world of buildings -- buildingsd made by true unfolding -- though created by men and women, is part of nature. Nature is not to be defined by the presence of living organisms. Nature, after all, does include the sand dunes of the Sahara, and the huge waves of the Pacific pounding the north California shore. These are "nature," but they are not organic in the sense of biological.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">They are part of nature because they are true, truly unfolded from the context which gave rise to them, through structure-preserving processes, and thus they are unfolded. They are created by what I define as living process. And because of that, they have living structure.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown"><i>That is what I believe we must mean by nature. It is only this definition in terms of truly unfolded structure, that characterizes ALL of what we think of intuitively as NATURE. This, I believe, is what we mean by "nature"</i>. According to this definition, many traditional buildings, and even a few buildings illustrated on this website -- perhaps some more than others -- <i>might also, and legitimately, be considered to be part of nature.</i> In that sense, then, there is room, intellectually, for us to include things that we have made in "nature."</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">What it depends on, is simply whether they are living structure, whether they were unfolded, and made <i>truly</i>, by a living process.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown"></font></p>

              <i>Community housing built recently in Indonesia, in which each dwelling is unique</i></font></h6>
            </center>
            <p><font color="brown">Of course, there is room for huge steps forward. People a hundred years from now, might be able to generate buildings, towns, sidewalks, shops, gardens, windows, in a way which is more true, which is -- therefore -- more fully, a part of nature.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown"></font></p>

              <font color="brown">-o0o-</font>
            </center>
            <p><font color="brown">With this new perspective, we may begin to imagine a new kind of nature; a nature which contains plants, earth, insects -- but also contains asphalt, fences, wires, human beings, hats and chairs. All together, as one unbroken fabric, this new nature is not nature in the old definition, yet is not "not-nature" (again, in the old definition).</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">This new, human-created nature <i>is</i> nature. It is nature because we have succeeded in making it with such love, and subtlety, that we have acted as nature does. It includes man-made things. And yet, it is made to be beautiful, as nature is; it is made as free; it is made as spirit.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
            <center>
              <font color="brown"><img src="venice1.jpg"></font>
              <h6><font color="brown"><br>
              <i>The man-made boat and the Venice lagoon are perfectly harmonious. It is ALL nature.</i></font></h6>
            </center>
            <p><font color="brown">In this new nature, as important that a tree is protected, preserved, it is important that the space under the tree is beautiful. It is as important that the landscape nourishes us, has living structure, as it is that the tree exists, has roots, has leaves and water to nourish it. This new nature, and this new land, is viewed as an image of man, at the same time that we recognize it as the living wilderness.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
            <center>
              <font color="brown"><img src="wilder3.jpg"></font>
            </center>
            <p><font color="brown">A beautiful, wildly living part of this new nature is protected, yet untamed; its grasses and plants, and benches and logs and sheep fences and compost heaps, interact, combine with the wild clematis climbing on the fence, and even -- with the racing car, the high energy sports car, the bike, the plane, the computer in the house.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">All this , in varying proportions in different places , is to be thought of as a single structure. Our effort is to make sure that it is living, according to the definition of living structure we can understand. Our pledge -- perhaps -- is to keep it intact, keep it living according to our ability to initiate and maintain living processes.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
            <center>
              <font color="brown"><img src="venice2.jpg"></font>
              <h6><font color="brown"><br>
              <i>Here there is nothing in the "old" sense of the word nature: but, in my new sense of the word, this, too, is ALL nature -- yet entirely made by people.</i></font></h6>
            </center>
            <p><font color="brown">Here, then, we do not merely judge it according to narrow ecological principles. We judge it according to the degree that is has formed living structure as an image of the human spirit. We judge it, according to the degree that it nourished the spirit, reflects the spirit, and is tied to us, by our own deepest cords.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">It is an new way of understanding ecology; a new way of understanding biology. We are part of it, and we are part of making it. There can be no apologies for that. Ours is a new era, in which the very idea of what nature is, is to be transformed.</font></p>
