      <td>
        <span style="font-size: 19px;">Dear Russ,</span>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;">As promised, I have spent two or three days looking at the Fairview site, photos, and information you have given me. I am writing to you, today, because I feel a growing concern about the arithmetic considerations of the project, when viewed within in the framework of the beautiful and idealistic conception that you have started with, compared with the practical physical realities that are needed to make this happen, TRULY happen, in the real world of Fairview.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;"><span class="h1class" style='font-weight:normal'>Introduction</span></span></p>
        <p>In order to start, I did these things:</p>
        <ul>
          <li>I read your new book, Reuniting Economy and Ecology: enjoyed it very much: nice and succinct.</li>
          <li>I looked as carefully as possible at the site plan.</li>
          <li>I looked, with some sense of shock at the very large number of existing buildings, and the land they consume.</li>
          <li>I did, as you suggested, try to lay out 100 houses, then 200 houses, on the mound marked E on your site plan.</li>
          <li>And I thought about numbers.</li>
          <li>And I tried thinking about the environment where people would really want to live.</li>
          <li>And I thought about the fact that you told me the target is some 1200 houses.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Before I go any further, I should say that I take as completely real, your desire for a genuine fusion of ecology and economy, for an ecological agriculture-based local economy in which the principles in your book are (as far as could ever be possible within the small compass of 275 acres), <u>be realized</u>. I take this very seriously indeed, and I asked myself repeatedly and continuously, what was needed to accomplish this.</p>
        <p>I also asked myself continuously, what would it be like, for this place to have the character that 1000 or 1200 families or households would be happy living there.</p>
        <p>What I encountered, in the course of my thinking, was very worrying. I gradually found myself asking more and more about two concepts:</p>
        <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A.</span></b> A genuinely integrated environment, where houses, gardens, work in the home, water, vegetation, sewage, food growing, and efficient economics of transportation and effective growth, all work together in a practical and realistic fashion.</p>
        <p><b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>B.</span></b> A condominium-like high density cluster of condominiums, made to <i>resemble</i> an Italian hill town, but not actually being one, and rather being more a speculative image of a high-density place which is done to make money and get by, but mainly just preserves some open land.</p>
        <p>These two, <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A</span></b> and <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>B</span></b>, are extremely different. I believe there is a considerable danger that, with all the good will in the world, even a highly sophisticated group of investors like yourselves, could too easily dream of <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt; mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A</span></b>, yet actually do <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>B</span></b>. In the course of the last three days of work, I have reached the conclusion that various forces, including the process you are currently following, will inexorably lead you towards <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>B</span></b>, while in your hearts you dream of <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A</span></b>, and while you also talk about <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A</span></b> to would be inhabitants, residents, and fellow investors.</p>
        <p>It would be tragic if you end up with <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>B</span></b>, when what you want is <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A</span></b> – not because <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A</span></b> is impossible, but <i>because you have not done the right arithmetic, nor made careful enough studies</i>, <i>ahead of time</i>, to make sure you are NOW setting out and determining and deciding to be on a path directed toward <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>A</span></b>. Business as usual, if you choose it, will lead you on another path altogether, towards <b><span style='font-size:14.0pt;mso-bidi-font-size:10.0pt'>B</span></b>.</p>
        <p></p>
        <h1>Physical principles that are needed to achieve</h1>
        <p>I outline the characteristics which I believe you are striving for, and which are, I think, needed to make people genuinely love the place.</p>
        <p></p>
        <ol>
          <li>Each house has a garden, even if tiny, for growing food as well as flowers.</li>
          <li>Every house is within a few steps of open land.</li>
          <li>Open land – agricultural and natural – is fully integrated, and interwoven with the texture of the houses and streets, so that they two are one thing, woven together, not merely coexisting in different parts of the same 275 acre parcel.</li>
          <li>Relatively little land is given over to asphalt, car or parking, yet every house, for the economy to flourish, must be easy of access, and quick of access.</li>
          <li>Houses and gardens are placed with respect to topographic features, trees, vegetation, slopes, sunshine and so on. This requires an intimate texture of small places, able to adapt to the local details of land, water, run-off, views, soil type, and so on. This requires a loose and highly flexible arrangement.</li>
          <li>People need to be able to shape their own houses for themselves.</li>
          <li>For those who want it, houses must be able to grow slowly, to avoid overcapitalization, and to reduce wastage on interest payments.</li>
          <li>Perhaps some part of every house is masonry – the solid part that forms the center of the house – while the rest, more easily changed and built onto, might be wood – hence cheaper and more flexible.</li>
          <li>Masonry might be earth-based material, possibly brick, or other natural-based material.</li>
          <li>There is workshop or office space in every house, making it-- and every person who lives there -- potentially a productive household – not merely part of a bedroom community.
            <p></p>

        <h1><span style='font-weight:normal'>Biggest Worry # One</span></h1><span style="font-size: 19px;">My first really big concern came from trying to put 100 houses on the mound called E (south of the horseshoe) -- as you and I discussed on the phone. I tried to do it, in such a way as to have small, but nice houses, with land. It is possible, but even 100 houses gets a very strange repetitive character that is created by fact that the houses are mostly too far away from open land. and too much of a two-dimensional sheet</span>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Also, when I made a second hundred next to them, it got much worse, and I then realised that 10 houses/acre will not do -- to get the number you want, you have to go to 15 houses per acre. <b>That is <u>extremely</u> hard.</b>, especially if you want it to be a place you can love (as we obviously want, for everyone</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;">My biggest fear is that the so called &quot;italian village&1uot; approach is almost certain to be fake! Italian villages work partly because they are stone -- solid, good acoustics, reall possibility of privacy. When you try to do it in wood frame, it just becoimes a postmodern or new urbanist fantasy, not pleasant, too tight, and no really lovable quality possible in the streets. That is what has been happening -- the new urbanists, fueled by development need for high density, just cram everything together in a dolled-up condominium, and pretend that it is an italian village. It isnt.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;">People with good sense probably wont want to live in the project, it if it is built that way.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;">This is what I meant earlier, by saying that the dream is of <span style="font-size:24px;font-weight:bold">A</span>, while the developer's reality, when carried out at 15 per acre, will be more like <span style="font-size:24px;font-weight:bold">B</span>, or entirely <span style="font-size:24px;font-weight:bold">B</span>. I believe that only the finger method, narrow fingers deeply interlocked with land, can solve this problem.</span></p>
        <h1><span style='font-weight:normal'>Biggest Worry # Two</span></h1><span style="font-size: 19px;">You can probably guess my second big worry. On the phone you suggested that we would be able to make a good cluster of 100 houses, in almost any master plan, provided that there are just very loose bubbles indicating where house-clusters are to go.</span>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;">Originally, I accepted this, as probably OK. However, from my studies I have come to believe this is fallacious. If what is needed to make a good environment is the imbricated finger-structure I have illustrated, then ANY bubble diagram will make it impossible to carry out properly, because it has the wrong topological structure.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;">I believe it is imperative that the master plan, and the application for zoning change, describe the imbricated structure -- if indeed, you accept my thinking, that this is probably the best, and possibly the only way, to make this project work as a genuine, new, "ecology-economy" project, which creates an atmosphere people will become emotionally attached to and can genuinely love.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;">A practical note: In my opinion, there would be no problem whatever, submitting a master plan of this type, with sufficient flexibility for future action, within the time space allotted.</span></p>
        <p><span style="font-size: 19px;">I hope this helps.<br>
        All the best<br>
        Chris</span></p>
