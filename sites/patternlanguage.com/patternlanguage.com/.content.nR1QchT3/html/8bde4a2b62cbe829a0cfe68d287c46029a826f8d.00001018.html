        <p>We have defined neighborhoods which have a population of approximately 200 families. These families belong to a variety of different income groups. Some are paid workers of the Carbozulia mine, others will have relatively well-paid work of secondary employment; others will be looking for work, or working temporarily, and will have marginal incomes.</p>
        <p>Analysis of similar situations in Venezuela and Colombia has given us a reasonably accurate estimate of the distribution of incomes we may expect among different families in the neighborhood, and also of the rate at which these families, of different income groups, may be expected to build increments onto their houses.</p>
        <p>Some of these results are taken from George Vernez's work in squatter settlements in Colombia. Others are taken from the simulations done by Echenique's group for the Guasara project. Of course, these figures are only estimates. As Echenique emphasizes, the final rate of spending for different families will depend on the level of subsidies which are available. Nevertheless, the following figures are important because they do give a clear overview of the type of situation we may expect among the inhabitants of Guasare new town.</p>
        <p>According to Echenique's projections, the income distribution in Guasare after the first five years will be:</p>

        <p>The income distribution among the families will influence growth of the houses. George Vernez, in his study of squatter settlements in Colombia* in 1970, observed the incremental construction of houses, and came up with the following figures:</p>

        <p>Based on the proposed financing programs for the construction of houses and on the figures observed by Vernez regarding the incremental growth of squatter settlement houses, the growth of the houses in Guasare, in the different income ranges, will be the following:</p>

            </td>
          </tr>
        </table>
        <p>In view of the fact that the different families in Guasare have relatively low capacity to pay for construction--whether they are paying back loans, or paying for construction increments directly--it will be necessary to provide an unusually wide spectrum of different financing programs to meet their needs.</p>
        <p>Very roughly, we believe that these financing programs must cover the following range of cases:</p>
        <p>1. Loans for construction of complete dwellings, in which families are not involved in the design (miners).</p>
        <p>2. Loans for construction of complete dwellings where families are involved in the design.</p>
        <p>3. Loans for construction of first increments of houses, for families who cannot afford (or qualify for) a full construction loan for a complete house.</p>
        <p>4. Loans for construction of subsequent increments, for families who have built a partial house, or for families who wish to enlarge their houses.</p>
        <p>5. Loans of materials for families who wish to build houses, or increments of houses, by themselves or with their friends.</p>
        <p>6. Loans for improvements in the streets, which are necessary to create the full neighborhood character of Guasare.</p>
        <p>In order to be practical, we feel that it is necessary to develop these financing programs in a way which fits in directly with presentday Venezuelan financing programs. We have therefore laid out on the following pages a definition of six financing programs, which are as far as possible consistent with present-day practice in Venezuela.</p>
        <p><u>1. Financing for the miners' houses</u></p>
        <p>Corpozulia will finance the construction of about 20 houses for miners' families in each neighborhood; these 20 houses will be the first building increment to initiate the development of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>Corpozulia will be the actual developer of this housing project, and therefore it will have to make an initial investment of about Bs.2.400.000 per neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The financial obligation of the miners residing in these houses towards Corpozulia will have either the form of rent or the form of monthly payments towards the amortization of the total cost of the house, depending on the form of tenure agreed upon between the miner and Corpozulia.</p>
        <p><u>2. Financing of a complete house</u></p>
        <p>We propose that INAVI initiate and direct a new financing program in Guasare, under which each family with a monthly income of more than Bs.3000 will have the opportunity to build a complete house of 60-80m2 in one step. This is quite similar to many programs which INAVI provides today. However, the major advantage of this program, and its difference from all other programs that have been directed by INAVI in the past, is the fact that families will lay out their own houses, and will therefore have the opportunity to build a house that fits their needs and fulfills their dreams, not a standardized prefabricated house.</p>
        <p>Each family eligible for this program will have the opportunity to take a construction loan from INAVI in an amount between Bs.60.000 and Bs.80.000. The amount of the loan to be given to the different eligible families will not be the same. The exact amount of each loan will be decided only after the layout of the house has been completed on the site, and will depend on the size and configuration of the house. The loan will be given to the family on the condition that the house will be built by the professional construction company appointed by Proguasare or INAVI to carry out the housing development of the neighborhood (see section 3).</p>
        <p>The loan will be given in draws, following specific construction operations, and a new draw will be issued by INAVI only upon completion of the previous building operation. The draws of the loan will be given directly to the construction company, who will administer the distribution of the loan to the different building operations.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that about 20-30 families from each neighborhood will have the possibility to benefit from this program. This number makes it profitable and economically feasible for a big construction company to undertake the construction of these houses.</p>
        <p>In accordance with INAVI practice, these loans should be given with an interest rate of 7%-8%, and an amortization time of 20-30 years.</p>
        <p><u>3. Financing program for the construction of the first increment of the house.</u></p>
        <p>We propose that Corpozulia assist all families with a monthly income less than Bs.3000 to carry out construction of the first increment of their house. We propose that this assistance take the form of a subsidy of Bs.16000 to be given by Corpozulia to the eligible families of each neighborhood.</p>
        <p>The subsidy will be given to the family on the condition that this money has to be used only for the construction of the first increment of the house, which will vary from 20-30 m2 . In order to control this, the subsidy will be given in the form of materials to be bought from the builder's yard, and in the form of paid labor for the builder or contractor hired by the family.</p>
        <p>This program will be addressed to about 150 families in each neighborhood, and will demand an initial investment by Corpozulia of about Bs.2.400.000 per neighborhood. The importance of this program lies first of all in the fact that with such a medium size investment by Corpozulia 150 new houses in each neighborhood will start being built rather early in the development process and quickly; and second, that only the existence of this program will make feasible the adoption of the "Programa de Creditos Populares" by INAVI, which is addressed only to the extension of existing houses-(see below).</p>
        <p><u>4. "Programa de Creditos Populares" for the construction of the second increment of the house.</u></p>
        <p>This is one of the current programs of INAVI, used for the extension and improvement of houses in the consolidated barrios of Venezuela. We propose that INAVI operate one of these programs specifically for the housing development in the neighborhoods of the town of Guasare, using the same conditions that apply for other barrios.</p>
        <p>The constraint on this program lies in the fact that it can be used only for the extension of an already existing house, i.e., for the construction of the second or third increment of a house. This means that the appropriate functioning of this program is contingent upon the existence of the subsidy program described in the previous section, which is needed to cover the expenses for the construction of the first increment of each house.</p>
        <p>All families with a monthly income from Bs.900 to Bs.4000 will be eligible for this program. The credit given under this program is a loan of Bs.5000-Bs.20000, with a low interest rate (4%-5%), to be amortized in a period of 5-20 years.</p>
        <p>The loan will be given in the form of materials to be purchased from the builder's yard, and in the form of labor paid to the builder or contractor hired by the family, and on the condition that the first house increment has been already completed. This loan will cover the expenses for the construction of 25-35 m2 of house, which will possibly comprise one to two rooms, and some covered outdoor space.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that some 120-130 families in each neighborhood will be able to participate in this program. INAVI will therefore have to make an initial investment of about Bs.2.500.000 per neighborhood.</p>
        <p><u>5. Credit for materials for the poorest families</u></p>
        <p>This is a small financing program, directed by Corpozulia, to assist the very poor families in the construction of a small second increment to their houses. The existence of this program is rather important, since it is addressed to the very poor families, those which the "Programa de Creditos Populares" by INAVI does not include in its program.</p>
        <p>This program will be addressed only to families with less than Bs.900 monthly income, and it will offer the opportunity for these families to obtain credit for materials to be purchased exclusively from the builder's yard. The maximum credit to be given under this program will be Bs.9000, enough to build 15 m2 of house, and it will be given upon completion of the first increment of the house.</p>
        <p>The credit for materials will take the form of a low-interest loan 2%-4%, to be amortized in a period of 5-10 years.</p>
        <p>There will be an average of about 50 families in each neighborhood that will be eligible for this program. That requires an investment by Corpozulia of about Bs.450.000 per neighborhood.</p>
        <p><u>6. financing program for the creation and improvement of streets</u></p>
        <p>This is a small but rather important financing program. The importance of this program lies in the fact that it will provide the means for the families to finish, improve and ornament the front of their houses and their garden walls. As we have observed, this is an essential feature of Venezuelan culture.</p>
        <p>This financing program, which must be initiated and directed by Corpozulia, will give each family with a monthly income of less than Bs.4000 a subsidy of about Bs.5000.</p>
        <p>The money will be given to each family on the condition that it will be spent for the following building and finishing operations:</p>
        <p>- construction of the front garden wall that faces the street, with the garden door or gate, and its finishing with small ornaments or details (20-70 m2 of wall, at a unit price of Bs.65/ m2);</p>
        <p>- making of ornaments over the main entrance door and over important front windows, and making of the cornice at the base of the roof (unit price Bs.450/house);</p>
        <p>- painting of the front of the house (20-40 m2 of painting, at a unit price of Bs.35/ m2);</p>
        <p>- finishing and paving of the front porch, or paving of a sidewalk along the front of the house (10-20 m2 of paving, at a unit price of Bs.45/ m2);</p>
        <p>- planting of trees along the front garden wall, on the side of the garden, to provide for shading areas along the streets and paths (2-6 trees per house)</p>
        <p>The subsidy should not be given to the family in the form of cash, but in the form of materials appropriate for the abovementioned construction operations and finishing. Also, the amount of the subsidy will differ from family to family, depending on the quantity of each of the above-mentioned items that their house includes.</p>
        <p>The subsidy for all these operations, except for the painting, will be given once, when the first increment of the house has been completed.</p>
        <p>The subsidy for the painting of the front of the house will take the form of a free paint</p>
        <p>program, to be used by the family every time a new increment is added to the house. This program will operate continuously for the first five years of the development of the neighborhood.</p>
        <p>It is estimated that about 200 families of each neighborhood will be eligible for the subsidy for improvements. The investment needed for this program is approximately Bs.1.000.000 per neighborhood.</p>

        </table>
        <p>We shall now describe the general approach to construction which must be taken in the neighborhood to accomplish the great variety of housing types which have been described so far.</p>
        <p>In this section we must distinguish between what is theoretical and what is practical. We begin by describing the theoretical.</p>
        <p>Theoretically, it would be desirable to have a system of production in which houses are built, in part by self help, and in part by a network of small contractors building houses one or two at a time for individual families. This combination would be ideal because it provides a low-cost system which is highly flexible, and capable of an enormous amount of individual attention. The houses are then built according to the individual needs of the families, and costs are kept low.</p>
        <p>In practice, however, this ideal is difficult to attain, especially in the Guasare region.</p>
        <p>There are two reasons. First, methods of self help need to be highly sophisticated in order to work efficiently. There is not sufficient experience with such programs in Venezula, and a large-scale attempt of this kind would probably fail.</p>
        <p>Second, the large number of small constractors needed for the second half of the "theoretical" program does not exist in Guasare. At the moment there is a small population in the region with relatively little construction experience. Although there will be more and more families and small firms with construction ability as the town grows, will take several years before this capability exists in sufficient quantities.</p>
        <p>As a practical solution to the problem, we therefore propose to begin with a highly organized system of construction management, which then gradually gives way to an increasing percentage of construction managed by the "theoretical" system which we have just described.</p>
        <p>The highly organized system that we propose will consist of a single major construction company, or public construction consortium, which undertakes responsibility for large parts of the construction. In detail, this company or consortium will have the following responsibilities:</p>
        <p>a. The construction of all 20-30 houses for miners' families within the neighborhood, of 120 m<sup>2</sup> each, financed by Carbozulia. The design and construction of these houses will be based on 4-6 archetypal house plans, and on a set of construction details the same for all houses.</p>
        <p>b. The construction of 20-30 houses for non-miners' families, of 60-80 m<sup>2</sup> each, financed by INAVI. The construction of these houses will be based on the layouts made on the site by the families, and on a set of construction details the same for all houses.</p>
        <p>c. The construction of the first house increments, of about 30 m<sup>2</sup> each, built with Corpozulia's subsidy, based on layout made on the site by the family.</p>
        <p>d. The construction of a small percentage of the second house increments of about 25-35 m<sup>2</sup> each, financed by the Programa de Creditos contractors and self help, it is essential that the construction system itself--the physical construction methods and details--be designed to permit all these different types of construction management to coexist. This will require the following specific conditions:</p>
        <p>1. All houses will be built according to the same system of details, in general use within the neighborhood, approved by the local building department, and compatible with materials sold through the neighborhood's builder's yard.</p>
        <p>2. Probably this system of construction will be based on the use of concrete block or brick.</p>
        <p>3. The system of construction will be simple enough so that families can also use it for themselves wherever they wish to become involved directly in the construction process.</p>
        <p>4. The components necessary for this type of construction will be available, on easy credit terms, at the neighborhood builder's yard, in accordance with the financing schemes defined in section 2.</p>
        <p>5. The system of construction will allow for certain portions which are labor intensive, so that they allow helpful and beautiful details to be built into the houses without unusual extra costs.</p>
        <p>It is also necessary that the negotiations and agreements which form the construction consortium, at the beginning of the construction, explicitly contain the clear understanding that large-scale construction will be gradually phased out and replaced by small-scale local construction and self help. It is necessary that this system of phasing out be made <u>absolutely explicit</u>, so that the momentum of the large-scale construction does not simply carry forward and prevent the healthy emergence of the smaller scale construction firms.</p>
        <p>We believe that the neighborhood builder's yards will also need to be subsidized by Corpozulia or Proguasare, so that they are incorporated from the outset as an essential part of the construction process.</p>

        <p>The builder's yard of each neighborhood will be responsible for accomplishing the following two tasks:</p>
        <p>1. Organization of the layout process for all non-miner's houses, an average of about 180 houses, and participation in the layout process of each house together with the family.</p>
        <p>2. Administraton and organization of the construction process for all houses built with self-help or by small contractors.</p>
        <p>A detailed description of these tasks follows:</p>
        <p><u>1. Organization and structure of the layout process</u></p>
        <p>The layout of each house will be guided by the set of rules defined in chapter 3. The staff of the builder's yard will be responsible for providing each incoming family which is ready to lay out their house with this set of rules, and for explaining the set of rules to them.</p>
        <p>The layout process will take place on the actual site where the house will be built. The family will be responsible for completing the layout, and the architect of the neighborhood builder's yard will assist the family in this task. The architect will spend one or two days with each family on the site for the layout of the complete house.</p>
        <p>After the layout has been completed on the site, the architect will have to make a rough drawing of the house, a one-line drawing at 1:100 scale, which will be a precise representation of the layout made on the site. The drawing will have to specify shape and size of different rooms and open spaces, and connections among them.</p>
        <p>The architect and the family will agree that this is the house that the family will build on this site. If the house is to be built incrementally, the family will also have to identify the building increments according to which the construction of the house will progress. If the house is to be built all at once by the construction company, the builder's yard architect will be responsible for providing the plan of this house to the company. After these matters have been clarified and agreed upon between the family and the architect, the family will immediately be granted the permit to start construction.</p>
        <p><u>2. Organization of the construction process by the builder's yard</u></p>
        <p>The builder's yard will be responsible for organizing and providing the necessary means for the construction of houses built either by the family itself or by a small contractor. In order to accomplish this task, the builder's yard will have to undertake the following activities.</p>
        <p>a. Purchase of building materials in bulk. The purchase of the large quantity of building materials will be made in order to cover the needs of the financing programs of INAVI and Corpozulia. INAVI and Corpozulia will directly finance the purchase of building materials, so that the builder's yard will be able to cover the needs of their programs.</p>
        <p>b. Distribution of building materials to the families. The builder's yard will be responsible for allocating and distributing materials to the families, according to the needs of the families. Materials will be given to the family upon presentation of the agreements between the family and INAVI or Corpozulia concerning the financing program in which the family participates.</p>
        <p>c. Provision and renting of tools. The builder's yard will be equipped with the necessary building machinery and tools so that it can provide these for the families either free of charge or on a rental basis.</p>
        <p>d. Technical advice and assistance. The people of the builder's yard will help the families and the small contractors in the construction of the houses. This will take the following forms:<br>
        - provision and explanation of a set of basic and simple construction details to be used for all houses;<br>
        - description and explanation of the sequence of building operations;<br>
        - participation in the actual building of the house on at least three separate occasions: the first at the foundation, the second at the time openings on the walls are placed, and the third at the beginning of the construction of the roof.<br></p>
        <p>The operation of the builder's yard will be under the responsibility and authority of "Proguasare," the development company for the town of Guasare, as proposed by ISA.</p>
        <p>The cost of administration per year, per neighborhood, should not exceed 5 per cent of its annual cost of construction. On this basis, it is estimated that the average cost of administration per year for each neighborhood should not exceed U.S. $24,000. This amount of money can pay for the annual services of two people working full time at a monthly salary of U.S. $1,000.</p>
        <p>Proguasare will organize administration in a decentralized fashion. Each neighborhood will administer its construction and overall production process by itself, through its local builder's yard. Therefore, Proguasare will operate a separate builder's yard in each neighborhood. Each yard should be located close to the center of the neighborhood along a main vehicular road, with a lot of storage space for construction materials and a small office. The builder's yard will be run and managed by two people, one of whom, we recommend, should be an architect, preferably a member of the ISA team, trained for one year by CES.</p>

        <p>In order to grasp the implications of the financing, administration and construction methods defined in the last sections, we end this chapter with a short overview of the actual growth process we may expect in a typical neighborhood.</p>
        <p><u>After one year of development</u></p>
        <p>The first buildings to be built in the neighborhood are the 15-20 houses for the miners. The houses for the miners will be located in groups of 3 or 4 along main and secondary streets.</p>
        <p>Next, the location of the houses to be designed by families and built complete is critical, since their contribution to the formation of streets and public places is more concentrated and substantial. These houses should therefore be built in places critical for the definition of streets and squares; they should be located on the corners formed by the secondary streets; and they should pin down the main square and street, or they should be located on the smaller squares and places along the secondary streets.</p>
        <p>During the first stage of the development of the neighborhood, houses to be built incrementally will be located along the main and secondary streets, on those lots standing between the complete houses. The first increments of these houses will have to be located along the street so that they contribute to the formation of the street.</p>
        <p>Garden walls of those houses which stand between the street and the private lot should be encouraged at this first stage of development. The subsidy program for "the embellishment and construction of streets" will help enormously to accomplish the construction of the garden walls along the streets.</p>
        <p>The planting of trees along the garden walls of the houses will have to be one of the first things that the family must take care of, even before any construction of the house increment starts taking place.</p>
        <p>The pavement of the main street and square will have been completed within the first year of the neighborhood development, while the secondary streets will have received at least the first coat of their pavement.</p>
        <p>The main square will be paved, planted with trees, equipped with the necessary street furniture and lighting posts.</p>

        <p><u>After two and a half years of development</u></p>
        <p>After two and a half years of development, the neighborhood will have about 40-50% of its construction volume completed. Some houses will be completed, most of the houses will have their second increment already built, and only a few of them will be in the initial stage of construction. Probably there will still be a handful of undeveloped lots.</p>
        <p>At this time most of the tertiary streets of the neighborhood will be clearly defined and formed. The secondary streets and the small squares along them will be fully paved, while the tertiary streets may still be undergoing paving. The streets will be embellished with small gates at their starting points, with some benches and fountains and trees where there is a widening or a small place formed along them.</p>

Most of the houses will be complete in their form, with the patio fully developed; some will still have only the first or the second increment built.</p>
