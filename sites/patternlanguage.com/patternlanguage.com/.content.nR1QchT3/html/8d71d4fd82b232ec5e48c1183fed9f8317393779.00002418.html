  <span style="font-size: 19px;">What is it, bs aside, that is really going to have this huge effect on Duncanville?</span>
  <ul>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">People, first. The spirit and desire to get it is the first thing.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">Each step making a difference economically, that is the second -- the synergy is visible and felt.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">A deliberate large-scale contribution to the physical public domain, in every single case, without exception.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">Investment by public works</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">A model of what we intend</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">Tools so everyone in the town can play the game.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">Owned by everyone -- a place truly loved and inspired.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">How is it going to draw on larger Dallas.: population of Duncanville obviously not enough to make a 3.5 main street viable economically, or pay for itself -- so Duncanville alone cannot (I think) make it work or pay for it. To make it a magnet for greater Dallas.</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">What is the "draw".</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">A nighttime extravanza... lights, globes of light...</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">A particular brand of hard working offices and businesses</span></li>
    <li><span style="font-size: 19px;">A family place weekends, sundays, etc.</span></li>
  </ul>
