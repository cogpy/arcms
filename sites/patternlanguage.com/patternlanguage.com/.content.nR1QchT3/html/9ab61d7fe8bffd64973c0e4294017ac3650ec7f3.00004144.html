        <p>Christopher Alexander is Professor in the Graduate School and Emeritus Professor of Architecture at the University of California, Berkeley.</p>
        <p>He is the father of the Pattern Language movement in computer science, and <i>A Pattern Language</i>, a seminal work that was perhaps the first complete book ever written in hypertext fashion.</p>
        <p>He has designed and built more than two hundred buildings on five continents: many of these buildings lay the ground work of a new form of architecture, which looks far into the future, yet has roots in ancient traditions. Much of his work has been based on inventions in technology, including, especially, inventions in concrete, shell design, and contracting procedures needed to attain a living architecture.</p>
        <p>He was the founder of the Center for Environmental Structure in 1967, and remains President of that Company until today. In 2000, he founded PatternLanguage.com, and is Chairman of the Board. He has been a consultant to city, county, and national governments on seven continents, has advised corporations, government agencies, and architects and planners throughout the world.</p>
        <p>Alexander was elected fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences in 1996, is a fellow of the Swedish Royal Society, has been the receipient of innumerable architectural prizes and honors including the gold medal for research of the American Institute of Architects, awarded in 1970.</p>
        <p>He was born in Vienna, Austria in 1936. He was raised in England, and holds a Master's Degree in Mathematics and a Bachelor's degree in Architecture from Cambridge University, and a PhD in Architecture from Harvard University.</p>
        <p>In 1958 he moved to the United States, and has lived in Berkeley, California from 1963 until the present.<br></p>
