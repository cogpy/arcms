          <p>ONE VERSION:</p>
          <p>Make a simple exterior wall plan. If the house can be one rectangle, great. A composition of several simple rectangles together is fine too.</p>
          <p>Whats the pecking order of the rooms (which should be biggest/most important?next, next. ) Locate the rough center of each of these major rooms. Starting with the most important room, keeping in mind that each room should a simple shape, almost always rectangular, let the most important room rectangle together with its thick wall, grow out from the rough center point you identified, until it bumps against exterior wall(s). Then do the same with the next room until it bumps into an exterior wall(s), or the previously made room. then next, then next. The spaces left over form bathrooms, closets, laundry, thick walls, etc.</p>
          <p>Using Nick's tartan grid generator, overlay a tartan grid onto the drawing so far. Drag and adjust the tartan lines, together with the walls below, until the plan is more regular and more beautiful. Not too regular, though. (I can explain more about Nick's tartan grid generator, if need be..)</p>
          <p>Going room by room, draw in, define and solidify the following: * Room corners (already pretty clear as to position) * doorways (interior, and exterior) * fireplace (if applicable, or other major center) * banks of windows, divided by small columns as needed (align columns and jambs to tartan as much as possible.) * darken in walls between windows, doors, and corners * stairs into/out of room * fatten, embellish and solidify walls as needed, adjust window positions slightly as needed.</p>
          <p>When done with all the major rooms, go through all the bits between, and fill in, closets, bathrooms, etc. following same steps.</p>
          <p>Conversion to CAD-like drawing: Every one of the things described above, is an object/center in the mind of the program. They are the entities of which the drawing is built. The tartan grid should be visible, both literally, and in the organization of every entity within the whole.</p>
