          <h3><font color="brown"></font></h3>
          <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
          <center>
            <font color="brown"><i>We assume the world is built largely by "developers". Is the developer harming or helping the environment?</i></font>
          </center><font color="brown"></font>
          <p><font color="brown"><br></font></p>
          <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">One may say that the developer is harmless, and that developers -- people who build for profit -- have existed for centuries without doing harm.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">But the scale and scope and character of modern development, are entirely new.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">If a developer builds a factory, say, for his own profit... at least he is still involved, it is local to him, he is able to make personal adaptation, there is, often, even vision in the undertaking. Above all, money and profit or not, it is still most often based on feeling .. hence on some kind of feeling for the whole.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">But the modern development process is based solely on money, not on tangible physical results. A group of investors, are based, say, in Florida, perhaps including people in Singapore and London.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">This group of investors place a certain capital sum in the hands of an agent, or broker, who seeks to "place it". He finds a project going on in Aspen Colorado -- a group of apartments for weekend skiers, say. This looks like an attractive investment. He recommends it. The money goes down. It is handled, locally, by a third agent, a real estate broker in Snomass, Colorado.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">The actual builder of the project is a fourth individual, and the craftsmen are five steps removed from the investors in Singapore and Florida. They have one driving rule, only, and that is the profit -- the return on investment -- which they are able to pass up the line, while each agent takes his cut. Finally, at the end, the investors in Singapore and Florida need 10, 20, 30% on their money.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">The project as a whole is driven by this motive. Any motive seeking to make the project well-adapted to the land, beautiful, touching to the people who live in it -- is entirely secondary. Sometimes, a glimmering of this motive enters the picture because -- in high end projects -- it is thought that these "amenities" will add to the value, and hence to the return.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Thus, even these beautiful and important aspects of living structure are introduced, in this case, only because they may increase profit, and they are done, cynically, then, with an eye to the bottom line, as it is experienced -- in cash -- by the investors in Florida and Singapore -- people who have never walked that land, who have, in to a near certainty, never even seen pictures of the land -- and who do not care about the outcome, except in so far as it brings them monetary rewards.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">That, in a nutshell, is the modern process of development.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">And versions of this process are used, even by the governments in communist countries, who, once again, build what they build, in a way that all the primary decision makers are absent from the project, uncaring about the individuals or the land, and care only that the project works financially, as an investment for the peoples government. Socialist or Capitalist, it is all the same. The modern process of development, has all but destroyed our capacity to create living structure in the world.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Each degree of separation, each bit of isolation between those profiting from a project and those who will actually inhabit it, drastically diminishes our capacity to create this living structure. Conversely, each degree of separation that can be removed, increases the chance that a living structure can be created. In an ideal world the person paying for the building is the one using it, inhabiting it, valuing it. If development must exist, we must find ways and methods that keep the source of money closely and integrally tied to the life of the project, without these degrees of separation. Only then can we increase the chance that living structure will be achieved.</font></p>
