  <p><font size="3">PATTERNLANGUAGE.COM</font> is a new internet company, formed as an outgrowth of thirty years of work at <font size="3">THE CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURE</font> a non-profit organization dedicated to the shaping of our built environment so that it becomes deeply comfortable, beautiful and supportive for all human beings. This website and this new company are dedicated to reaching people of all walks of life who share our concern. In small ways (the design of a garden, the refurbishing of an attic into an extra room), or in larger ways(the revamping of a neighborhood, planning for a new office building), we all play our part in shaping our environment, which in turn shapes us. Since 1967 CES has been developing architectural design and construction methods that are now being adapted for our website so that millions of individuals, organizations, and communities can use them. CES has also been involved in the social, scientific and artistic ideas and methodologies that support these efforts. The website is being developed for those needs as well. Please click for the site map and travel with us.</p>
  <p>PatternLanguage.com is a corporation, supported by the internet business it conducts. We plan the creation of the PatternLanguage.com Foundation, to provide help to people all over the world who need these services, on a non-profit basis. The Center for Environmental Structure is a non-profit educational foundation, and will continue to receive grants and donations for the public good, to promote the intellectual ideas and resources described in the web site.</p>
