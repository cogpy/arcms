I am using this site for the highest of purposes : motivation,....... so I appreciate the response. One of our traditions is that real truths are so precious that they must be held secret and guarded closely for power, security, or profit. I submit that this strategy has outlived it's usefulness. ....................... In the same vein, I further offer for your consideration the concept that there is no such thing as evil ,....... only misapprehension. Mistakes compound and emotion becomes misled. The perfection of "The One and The Other " is corrupted into the "us and them" as the source of so much human conflict. ...................................................The power to smash at a distance becomes the comsuming passion, the simple,dead lead pellet disintegrates the profoundly complex, but still we build and always we build, even as we knock it down........................................................................................ I am reading the Alexander pieces on the redefining of nature with guarded interest. The premise seems sound, but where is the acknowledgement of motivation and purpose in either "old" or "new" descriptions. ................................................Philosophy collapsed beneath an edifice of words fifty years ago;...in this century we must cut to the chase: Logic and Rational Mind are an axiomatic Identity....... Order depends on Logic for endurance ,and this is where the end-orientation, purpose, and meaning reside. Science has been "value-free" for three hundred years, but it has reached the end of the road now . Unless science can incorporate the connectivity of all aspects of "The Observable" it will only reap diminishing, irrelevant, and unethical returns from here on out. We have entered the emergent phase where we really do have the power to decide what nature and creative mind are to become ....... We are the "New Player".........................................................................................I was lucky today, I built a new arbor for an old vine with the help of young men, life is good sometimes in a gentle way.....................................................Cheers, Friends,..D.V.</font>

It was a thousand square foot or so deck job, not my design or bid, but my contractor friend got over-committed and the client was getting bent pretty bad so Bruce called me in as a smokejumper to put out the fire. ...... The project was pretty O.K., but the kick was in running the crew.

I remember being shocked a few years back working on a job with my Dutch cabinetmaker/carpenter friend Johan, we were doing some tricky thing with a threshold or something, I expressed my admiration for his technique, and his reply really made me stop and think. He said, " Dirk, for some time now, the hardest part of my job is not figuring it out,finding material, or doing the work---, it's getting agreement and approval from the clients." ...... hmmmm.............an implicative mind might see a universe in this, I've often thought since.</font>

Alexander is right about a lot of things, and he's right about what's behind and underneath those things, and he's correct in stating that seeing truth, and acting on it, is only the beginning of the process of change.................... Since we are at the beginning of a new post Cartesian era in thinking we need aknowledge that Psychology and Ethics need the kind of time on the bench that Art and Science have been getting. C.A. does it beautifully, and he's really the first to come out and say it, and his work is a book for the ages, kind of like 'Origin of Species', but it needs a primer,like "Lord of the Rings" needed "The Hobbit".........................And another thing, this truth we are working on clarifying has to deliver power, responsibility, and contentment to people have only ever felt it through Occasional "peak experiences" in the past. .... It sounds like sales; it is!: Nature is the original free enterpriser. Extension and elaboration her drive, flowing into all the niches. Creators in training we are, sure , but on the job training, because we are building the "fields of centers" right alongside Mother Nature now. .........................This is all cool stuff but the packaging has not been sent out yet in a way that can be assimilated by the present debilitated cultures.

                I came across an essay on mayan architecture and its represenation of time (the source now long lost) that contained the following quote:<br>
                "communication does not change the medium nor the message, communication simply causes the subject to return to its origination. That is the fundamental consequence of proper communication. An author can lead the individual, but only the individual can carry the subject back to the throne from whence it came."<br>
                The Architecture itself was a means to perpetuate life through the cycles of time, the eternal life.<br>
                Thought it was interesting and pertinent, just wondering on some other takes on this theme... :)</font>

"We must begin to read nature for an intent". The only real question for us from now on is :What is the human to become? We all go down this road together or we don't go at all. If we can't get science and religion together in the next hundred years or so earth consciousness may not survive the crossover phase emerging from genetic to rational control. I'm a simple fisherman and builder. I'm not equipped to handle the load I found myself with. I have built some including a succesful coffeehouse in Niles Ca and some boats and houses. I know when my eye is good and when the saw is true in the cut and I have learned to love those times because I know it's not always so and will not always be so. And I have a wonderfull girlfriend who I would not be me without and my eight year old duaughter who is Deaf who really opens my eyes like any child can if you let them. I fished western Alaska for twenty summers when I lived in the northwest and usually I had the Pattern Language or the Timeless Way in my seabag. I showed Alexander to George years ago when he was still alive and we were working together a couple of afternoons a week and he liked the ideas but couldn't find sufficient rigor to hold his attention , much like the "hidebound scientists and philosophers " he faulted. He would have been very proud of the Nature of Order however and very pleased at the display of courage it took to get it here. Courage ...one of only a few meaningful things the universe is currently producing here on the planet. I phoned alexander years ago and thanked him for the courage his work had given me . I would like to take this chance as I join your group to renew that gratitude and congratulate him and his team for their hopeful and meaningful work of art, science, ethics, and spirituality.

                I must tell you first I am not an architect. I am a software engineer but I am trying to build a new kind of computation which is based on the idea of story telling and comprehension. . If you are interested you can visit my site www.visualanalytics.com.au Without jumping into any conclusion I shall like to read /see a little of the work you have done and shall be happy to engage into some discussion about future work. Although I am a software engineer working for the last 20 years in this field, currently I have registered my self as a PHD student at ADFA [australian defence force Academy ] where mostly I do my research on my own. I am looking out to collaborate with some one interested in buiding procedures in architecture based on my computational model which is based on ‘resolution’ of meaningful sentences which is what stories are about.<br>

                I am interested in discussing what CA has to say about the matter of function and ornament. Is anybody out there to talk to?

                Don't quote me on this, but I recall reading something in the original PL on the comparison of different materials: wood versus metal versus earthen products and the production (mining) and overall sustainability. Also, The Production of Houses uses concrete material as a method of construction, at least in the slab foundation and roof structures specifically. i believe? And you could maybe include in this, the walls if you count the earthen bricks manufactured on site. anyway</font>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">A recent UK government report of life-satisfaction http://www.strategy.gov.uk/reports/reports.shtml suggests several influences on our personal happiness, from genetics to wealth, education and relationships. There are some interest figures in the report relating to the significance people give to housing for their satisfaction in everyday life. It seems when asked people place it below leisure activities, but when measured (I'm not sure quite how) it comes out much higher - only family life, marriage and financial situation are more important. Which when you look at page 46 and see that time spent on care of our houses comes second only to child care and exceeds the time spent on feeding ourselves it's no wonder.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">It would seem there is great potential to improve quality of life through better housing and that this is already being undertaken by ordinary people in their own time. The document suggests that in the UK the value of this unpaid work is something like £175 billion! Globally this must make looking after our homes one of the most important industries in the world.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The question though is - "Do we get £175 billion in satisfaction for our efforts?"</font></p>

In each home I have lived in, I have noted the characteristics that improved our quality of life, and those which made me curiously depressed...</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have wanted to build residences since I was four years old. I have a passion for throwing out the notions of 'less expensive=poor design', 'one basic bungalow/split level will suit any kind of family', and that merely covering the basic space needs of people will result in a livable space.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The home we currently live in has some lovely qualities. We enter from a large entrance deck at the west (back) side of the house. The outside door opens directly into the kitchen, which is quite inconvenient for a family of 6, but we're greeted with sunlight from the kitchen's full-length patio doors as well as from the living rooms tall windows, directly across. My husband said as soon as he saw the quality of light in those two spaces, he knew it would be a good place.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The home we're planning to build is a monolithic dome home. Have any PL people been involved with the construction of a home like this? I am confident in my current design (which is nearing the 'professional stamp of approval' stage), that we will have a light-filled, cozy, varied interior. I am having issues with the exterior, though. The exterior rooms will be lovely - my concern is with the immediate transition between the dome and the outside. There will be no wings extending from the dome; on the basement level (3' below grade), a sunken & grade level patio with terraced beds, but beyond that is a required flood-proofing berm.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am most certainly not expecting free design advice - I was hoping to make contact with some people here who may have actually worked on a similar project.</font></p>

                After I placed my last note, I thought, wouldn't it be interesting to get some current reflection from PL on the previous volumes from the CES. Whatever happened to the Oregon Experiment? Is the Mary Rose sunk forever? Why?<br>
                What could have been done differently? How could the latest understanding and/or methods have been put in place to make a difference.<br>
                I know "what if's" are limitless, but maybe if those who where there could create a daily coffee article to touch upon each volume - covering the hits & misses, etc.<br>
                Something we could all learn from.<br>
                #19 may be very difficult, but very exciting. I think it speaks to the core of the N.ofO. Independent centers working to re-enforce the whole.<br>
                If it can't happen on a website, where can it happen?</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">5. Keep developing such tools as the SVG tool to be a design tool and promote and market this alongside other CAD tools, or somehow integrate it. There is no CAD design tool at the moment, so far as l am aware.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">6. A show and tell board for ordinary architects, as opposed to famous ones, as well as D.I.Y selfers with a chat room associated to the examples of their work. This might include room for a sketch pad and photos.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">7. A section dedicated to the collection of patterns, or pattern languages, according to country and region.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">14. Ensure that the potential and possibility for dialogue is never closed, or be more pro-active and responsive in allowing dialogue to happen.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">15. Put most of the coffee section articles in archive and try to get more current and 'live' letters, rather than repeated sermons.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">16. Put some faces to the people behind PL. Updated photos of people working at the PL office.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">19. Find more creative and interactive ways of harnessing the energy of the users of the site, to contribute to it's life, design, layout etc... rather than take on the sole responsibilty of labour for its maintenance.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi Vasko,<br>
                Thank you for your insightful response. I have not had the advantage of that type of experience or viewpoint- but it is greatly appreciated.<br>
                And I agree with you (if this was the point you were intending) - the "first world" countries have lost the appreciation for the PL's or a common language; at least at the professional level.<br>
                We put it aside when we fell in love with the idea of the machine.<br>
                The promise of an efficient future of ease. Read almost any architect's viewpoints from the beginning of the 1900's even up to some of the present day notables. Although, today instead of the "machine" - it's technology.<br>
                And It is not the be all & end all.<br>
                But we as "cutting-edge" societies put so much of our livelyhood into it. Our hopes and dreams, our future and our present. It gives us the power to get ahead of the other guy, "Got to get that extra edge."<br>
                All the while, unconciously putting aside what makes us human.<br>
                Maybe I can't speak for a whole society, but what seems to occur in my daily community puts more and more value on a certain intellect. Not on wisdom per se. But in the power of information; and the ability to weld it (or keep it from) others through a tangled web of laws and regulations.<br>
                The walls that separate, are no longer physical stones set on top of each other, they are stones set on paper and in thoughts.<br>
                *hop*<br>
                - jumping from atop my soapbox.<br>
                the reason I said all that<br>
                was to get to this.<br>
                Architecture (on this side of the road) as set itself atop a very fragile pedestal.<br>
                Where as, the building/construction you described, is very straightforward, honest, and even common (some would say).<br>
                We have developed a purposely complicated system to keeps us alive and important* to society.<br>
                *{A thought held mostly just by architects themselves.}<br>
                You only have to go as far as our laws to discover this. An architect, as a profession, is held together by a collection of words.<br>
                In my opinion, if that is the only thing keeping you from the great abyss of the unknown - then it's time to do some serious soul searching.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">And you're right, money is just a tool. Just as are knowledge, laws or techology. The responsiblity rests on us on how we choose use them.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">To answer one of your earlier questions:<br>
                the role/relationship of patternlanguage.com to the rest of the community?<br>
                From what I understand<br>
                PL was a part of the birth of the patterns community. It has choosen to re-introduce itself and again become an active part, while trying to introduce additional theories, to enrich this on-going experiment. I think it's success maybe found in the degree it tries to reach out and engage this audience, while bringing in more and more of the world into this discussion.<br>
                This has to be at least a two-way conversation. But at the moment, the balloon seems to be limp. The current format is an improvement over the earlier versions, but I think there is a long road ahead. Maybe this website as a vehicle needs to be revaluated? Maybe it is something as simple as changing out the old square tires for some new round ones. I ithink the deabte, or at least concern, that is happening here is a good start. But maybe it could progress to the point of us "visitors" offering suggestions, models, or just some plain resources.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My 2 cents:<br>
                #1) I would like to be able, when I enter the hompage, to know what areas or information has been significantly updated. I know this is a lot of work in itself, but something that would add to experience of the site.<br>
                Maybe a notice that ties in with the 'Welcome back' pop-up that highlights the changes/additions over the past month.<br>
                #2 The Chat rooms: Make smaller rooms based on the specific topics.<br>
                #3 I miss the daily coffee. Maybe make it just a weekly thing.<br>
                #4 Some of the 'Links' seem to be out of order. and few more for a wider selection.<br>
                #5 who are the key members of the CES? and what are their roles.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The question of time is interesting when it comes to life.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">If you are talking about real communities, they take hundreds of years to organically grow.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Designing a house can take an hour or two, in some cases even less. l have found that the most succesful designs, ironically, have been generated in the least time, often, and in the most dificult contexts.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">From my experience in Melbourne, and particularly amongst migrant working class clients, there is a suspicion, a healthy one, about good design taking a long time.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Don't forget, everyone can design... as most people are in the first instance more or less in contact and know their own needs.<br>
                It's not a huge step to take the clients brief, or their needs, into a pattern language for the project... most of the design information is, including the solutions and the spaces, within the clients own brief, or their expressed needs.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Money?<br>
                It probably does not boil down to an idividual viewpoint of money, but it probably is more related to culture and class.<br>
                Those who are more willing to spend money on improving their life, generally have more money to spend, not only on design but across many areas of their lives...<br>
                Those who are least willing to spend money on design, generally are also those who have least money to spend. l believe that although this is less true in western countries, it is more true on a world scale. It is also true in newly developing western countries.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In the example l gave of my experience with migrant working class clients... it is true that most now could afford to pay for design but they don't for many reasons. Two that stand out for me are:<br>
                1. Design does not give them the 'bang for their buck', where mental labour is undervalued in comparison to physical labour. They would pay you to dig a trench but not to design their home.<br>
                2. Most migrant working class clients come from peasant villages where they built their own homes... this was so for as far as they could remember... their were no architects.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">People who come from post industrial societies, anglo's, as clients fall into two categories, when it comes to paying for design.<br>
                1. Those who can't afford design<br>
                2. Those who can afford it but can't build. The 'pattern languages' have been lost. They were lost through the industrial process.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Look around in your community and see who pays for design and who doesn't. l think you will find that it is not just individual pespctive, but there will be some common patterns. l would be interested to hear your observations.</font></p>

I feel the concepts here would have more &/or deeper impact if they were presented differently. Is there a way the orginaztion (CES) could improve the site by asking for/receiving help from those of us visitors that have an interest in what's going on here? I have another question: If you are trying to create an object or place that, by theory, can have varying levels of 'life'; what is the right level? How much is too much, how much is not enough? It obviously takes time to add or create this 'life'. and since time is money, and time (as a resource) is quickly becoming something of a precious commodity ... I guess the question I'm getting at is: What is the role of Time in the creation of life? At what level of importance should it require?<br>
                How am I to convince a client that by spending a little extra time at certain phases of a project, that the end result will have more 'life'? And to twist a borrowed phrase "What's in it for the client?"<br>
                Does it really all boil down to our individual viewpoint of money?<br>
                Some willing to spend for higher quality versus those not willing to spend?<br>
                Any comments from the few that visit this part of the site would be appreciated. Thanks.<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi Bella,</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In response to some of your questions and comments;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">1. l have not seen 'hard' evidence by others of PL reducing costs.<br>
                My understanding so far, of PL, is that the method and application of PL improves the meaning and increases the 'density' of built spaces... because of the way the patterns overlap, and because PL are based on needs rather than on current fashion.<br>
                From this angle, it can be claimed that PL do save costs.<br>
                This claim however is made by every other architectural firm... that architecure and architects, through expertise of design can yield optimum levels of usable space for construction costs. In reality, this is often not the case.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">PL do provide a common language... particularyl if the brief for the project can be developed into a pattern language for the project.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The time savings of PL are that time 'wasted' in design is reduced because the PL are allowing 're-use' of experience and ideas, rather than re-inventing the wheel.<br>
                As a friend of mine once put it "architects, too much of the time are trying to invent a new roof (as and example), where, every possible roof that can be built, has been built".</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">From responses by clients, it seems that clients are pleased with the particular approach that PL use, as well as the built product that they end up with.<br>
                What is particularly revealing is the amount of clients who come unsatisfied with previous designs of architects and then are really pleased after re-designing their home by using PL.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">2. l have some of my own personal ideas about why l think PL are not in more widespread use, but l do not know for a fact... or from any long experience.<br>
                Clients are more interested in PL than directors of architectural firms as they have more interest in their homes being designed to suit theur own needs.<br>
                Architects and directors are less interested as the profession tries to mystify architecture... a bit like keeping a secret recipe a secret, so that it can be sold.<br>
                Because PL are based on simple rules, there is a rejection on the grounds that they do not allow individual creativity. This is a serious misunderstanding about the role of rules in PL.<br>
                l have found that the rules infact allow greater creativity, as well as incredible flexibility in design. Clients can also relate to this, as well as the fact that PL rules talk about real problems and propose real solutions.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l think that PL do have a feminine quality. l do not know whether women are more 'predisposed' to PL because of this.<br>
                Many of the families l have worked with in design, the women have taken leading responsiblity and involvement in the design process and often the construction stage too.<br>
                The emphasis is in the connectivity of the patterns, particularly the connectivity of patterns dealing with external (garden) spaces and internal patterns of the building dealing with circulation.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The question of why patterns are not in more widespread use needs also to be answered together with other related questions about architecture and building.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The example of Henley Homes using bad patterns rather than good patterns is one example of this. It probably is cheaper for Henley to use foil rather than warm by the sun. The context that they do this in is big and deep.<br>
                As a starting point, town planning and the layout of streets and subdivisions ignore most things that would make the implementation of good patterns possible.<br>
                Town planning is in turn influenced by other things ie: economics and industry, politics and culture. As town planning design is not based on a wholistic approach itself, ultimately the problem becomes one of bad patterns begetting bad patterns.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have been reading the past entries in this discussion with interest.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am currently exploring the use of patterns and pattern languages within business settings- specifically looking at their potential in capturing and communicating knowledge with regards to ICT (information and communication technology) design and implementation.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Reading up on the work of Alexander and others, a number of interesting questions have arisen that you may be able to offer some further insights into:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">1. In your experiences how do patterns really improve architecture? From the discussions that have arisen the main benefits of patterns appear to be their role in providing a lingua franca and facilitating communication with end users and customers. However is there any evidence of patterns providing ‘hard’ benefits i.e. reducing costs, and speeding up the design and implementation process- both in physical architecture and software design? Within the context of software design are the end users of the software really more satisfied, is the software easier and more pleasant to use?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">2. Why have patterns and pattern languages been largely rejected in their field of origin, i.e. physical architecture? Vasko do you have any further insights into this area? Why are clients attracted to APL and not the directors of architectural companies? I am interested in your comment hinting that women may be more predisposed to pattern languages! I am also interested in your comments on the prevalence of ‘bad’ patterns due to their published and ‘gospel’ status, and also the bureaucratic trappings of a capitalist society. The example of Henley Homes using ‘bad’ patterns is notable. Would it not be cheaper for them to exploit nature’s central heating by building north facing living areas instead of forking out for additional insulation and aluminium lining? However I presume that there is some sort of economic incentive to ignore this pattern- presumably they can build more houses on any given plot of land and increase the returns on their investment?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">3. How can patterns be validated? Many sources refer to observable application in three different contexts. However, how do you define ‘different’ contexts?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I appreciate that I have asked a lot of questions that do not have simple answers, but look forward in engaging in active discussion with those interested J</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I would also be interested in collaborating in writing a pattern language with anyone interested as it may strengthen my understanding of what makes a useful pattern and how they can be utilised to positive effect.<br></font></p>

              <blockquote>
                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi there Pronob,</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">They all sound interesting. How will the toolkit be used on the forum?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Regarding the future of the forum, or its best use, my own feelings are these:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">1) That the forum is primarily best as a linking tool for people, nationally and internationally. So in that sense, it can assist as an organisational tool.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">2) That the forum has limitations as a tool for ongoing education, particularly around heavier theoretical material which needs "fleshing" out and a more disciplinary approach to study and discussion.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">3) As entries can only be brief, and the particular format of this way of communicating with one another has the tendency to limit the amount of people who can join in, then only brief discussion can be held... which makes it probably more suitable for information sharing and informing one another about particular issues and our interests.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Having said this, l am still interested in your suggestions, particularly being able to collect or build pattern languages... so how is the best way to do this... the forum, a parallel forum, (possibly your own site, almost as an attachment to this one??? l don't know).</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My own particular special interest is:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">1) An actual pattern group or groups on the ground. The groups can act as support groups for people interested in patterns, to promote and help each other to learn about pattern languages, and to help people like yourself in taking pattern languages to educational institutions. As well, they can be study groups... around any topics, for example we can discuss the Nature of Order once we have all read it.<br>
                The groups can also be multi-disciplinary and need not be limited to any particular field.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">2) Actual projects on the ground. There is a fair criticism of groups and associations, that they tend to fizz out if they are not part of any real outcomes on the ground.<br>
                So examples of patterns projects do themselves create networks, and vice versa. This can be done in our workplaces. For example l could use the pattern languages with my clients as an axample of patterns used for the design of a buildable house.<br>
                In this respect, a patterns group could be useful for someone like me for advice on how to implement the projects.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Going back to the PLOPs conference... for me admittedly it was too narrowly focussed and specific to the programming field.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l was interested however in Jim Copliens idea of joining forces, and making groups more multi-disciplinary.<br>
                This can also help to bring in people from outside the professions that we are involved in.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Again having said all this, l guess the forum can be used in any way that people want really... it need not be limited to any particular use... it can be different things to different people.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l'll pause for now and wait for any response.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Talk to you again.</font></p>

                I have not been visiting the site for the last couple of weeks -so I idd not read your posting till late yesterday.<br>
                That is the reason for the delayed response. I shall like to know more about Plops.I went to their site to find some proceedings -but they have not been posted yet. But I will be interested to find out your experience as an architect listening to software professionals talking about patterns.<br>
                So please do post your comments in that regard.<br>
                About your suggestion about rethinking the future of this forum: What I shall like to bring in is discussion and interaction in a a way of programming patterns. This will provide the participants a common collection of a few things: 1.Collection of patterns.<br>
                2.A Java based toolkit to study the interaction of these patterns in terms of cluster of keypoints within scenes. 3. A scrpting langauage [similar to Java but easy for non-programmers to pickup] to interact with the toolkit.<br>
                4. The toolkit and programming may sound too technical for this forum but from my way of thinking[in the absence of the infrastructure out there in the real world] that is one way to have a feel how patterns can interact in reallife.<br>

                l must admit, not being from a software background l did find the conference- as well as the reference to patterns from a software perspective quite unfamiliar and foreign.<br>
                Its as if the idea of patterns was a totally different language.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Also Pronob, l have now received the first of Christopher Alexanders books on the Nature of Order and l am busy reading it, trying to catch up to the discussions which have lately made some reference to it.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l wanted to propose something, in view of the fact that there has been a short break in the forum.<br>
                That each of us who have been involved in the forum make our own synthesis of what we think the discussions and ideas have been so far, and also our interests for future topics as well as what we think the best way to use the discussion forum can be.</font></p>

In short my view of adoptive /adaptive computer systems is the current technology [hardware/software] is not able to go deep enough into our perceptions to be able to be adaptive in the sense of an automated process. We still need real human/computer interaction and an adptive system should emerge where human input is one of the driver of adaptation. The current ventures like modelling on ants behaviour might give us some interesting algorithims and resultant smarter software -which will be just interesting-it will not bring us breakthrough in bringing up software quality or putting software into social infrastructure -to help us in any major way. Your comments please.<br>
                I have to go now.<br>

                I like your comment about "incredibly beauty that is to be seen in all living systems is the flowering of the innate creativity" This is interesting in reference to my open question. Say, you show a 2 year old first time in her life something like a nice art work or some thing natural like a big flower and you ask " do you like it" or "do you want it"?. Most of the time the answer will be "yes". Now assuming the child has never seen the art piece or flower before-the fact is the child appreciates something in it innately, without learning from anyone.. I make the point that the child has somehow identified with the object. Our ability to absorb "knowledge" I believe is something innate in us through some sort of identification with the object and process we develop the knowledge about. As we are slowly brought into the social education system this ability to identify with the knowledge is more and more overlooked and ignored. This is very much enhanced by the presnt reductionist approach to analyse everything into its pieces<br>
                My approach is if we can some how bring this innate ability in us to play a role in our society -our every day transactions, then it will simply bring in a new dimension in society and bring in new ways for education as well. Fact is although our social and education system might have had ignored this human ability -it is none the less still there with every human being.<br>
                I have sometimes tried to find a pattern for this innate human ability to absorb the knowledge. I have found it very closely associated with human creativity . I have found it ingrained in our spiritual rituals. No matter what kind of relegion or spiritual descipline you consider,probably you shall find the following pattern :<br>
                Pattern: Spiritual Prayer<br>
                Scene1: Stillness and Concentration<br>
                Here the person prepares for the spiritual session -the person takes him/herself to a location and environment where he/she will not be interrupted and shall be feeling connected to immediate surrounding.<br>
                Scene2: Admission of Helplessness and Humility, Openness.<br>
                Here the person opens up and admits he/she has got very limited knowledge in the field he/she currently in and is tied to all sorts of circumstances and implores for help.<br>
                Scene 3 : Aspiration<br>
                Here the person is aspiring to understand things in his/her field he/she has not understood yet and somehow surrenders to the process with a belief that the prayer will be granted.<br>
                Depending on the particular relegion or spiritual system there can be other scenes in the sequence. Also there will be variations [ change of focus] in the scenes depending on the personality and ofcourse what other patterns the person has been influenced by at that moment.<br>
                But the point is this is a very human sequence that is been practised for ages in all sorts of culture and I beleive it will have some empirical evidence that it enhances our innate ability to absorb knowledge and act differently in our own circumstances.<br>
                So my refernce to knowledge was this kind of knowledge and understanding. The fact that this knowledge can be gained without doing any reductionist experiment while our sense of logic and scientific approach remain intact points to the fact that these knowledge can and do coexist in our society while we carry out all other social ,business and scientific transactions objectively.<br>
                Now it is possible this kind of knowledge adds something to the human being in the physical sense. That was my open question: do you believe that such knowledge can have a existence in the space in and/or around the human being?</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">You might be wondering what all these have to do with how we design our computer systems. In that respect your remark on the adoptive-systems was interesting -which I shall take up shortly in another discussion.<br>
                Shall speak to you soon.<br></font></p>
