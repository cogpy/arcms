          <h4><font color="brown"></font></h4>
          <p><font color="brown">A new topic. We need your help.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">The main idea of this website -- ultimately of everything on the site -- is that it HELPS people. It is intended to help people make better houses, neighborhoods, office areas, work-places, parks, gardens, and so on -- FOR THEMSELVES.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">This is a noble aim, and a fairly easy aim to <i>imagine</i>. However it is much easier said than done. Although the tools we are beginning to provide on the site, clearly are helpful -- I am talking here about the pattern language, the sequences for generation of buildings, the tools for making neighborhood green space, the much larger tools to help participation in large scale planning decisions in a county -- all this is very much easier to SAY than it is to DO it.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">I am aware of this because now that we have the very rudimentary mechanics of the site worked out, I find myself day after day, looking at what we have made available, and asking myself how it can be made <i>more</i> <i>useful</i>, <i>more</i> <i>helpful</i>.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">And I have been shocked to find out, how relatively hard it is, to meet this simple objective. So, thinking about it, after discussing it among ourselves here at PatternLanguage.com, I have decided to ask very bluntly and specifically for your <i>help</i>.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">All of you -- or at least many of you who look at the site, have an interest in helping us to make it more helpful, more practical, more useful on a daily basis. If we find out how to do this more, it will work better for everyone.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">So, if it is not too much trouble, I would like to ask you to write to me, personally, and tell me any ideas you have, for making our material more helpful, more useful, and more likely to help people make the environment better.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Since the site is in its infancy, there are many obvious things not working yet... and you will no doubt mention these things if you write to me. But, also, I hope you will put on your thinking cap, ask yourself, how you can give a really helpful answer to my question, then sit and write me a quick e-mail... I promise you you will find the content of your ideas and comments reflected in the modifications we make in the next mon6th or two.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Please write me!</font></p>
