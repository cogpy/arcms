        Suppose I am trying to visualize a perfect place for drawing. I remember an ideal place, where I once very much enjoyed drawing. It was a large high table, with a very big window to the right, with lots of panes, and my brushes to the left away from the window.</font>
        <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">This "thing" that I remember, the thing which exists in my mind, may be thought of as a pattern. But it is also, nearly always, a pattern of a possible kind of center. The elements that make this center are the following: the table, the window, and the brushes. But the essential thing, is the space on the table, between the window and the table and the brushes, which makes this space a center. It is a center that lets me draw as nicely as possible.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">Every pattern that defines a center always has the same format. There is a center (which is always a space) created by some elements which surround it. This structure is fundamental. The space is the heart of the thing.. Then, there is a crust or boundary around this center, which forms it. The crust or boundary is always made of solid elements. In the case of the DRAWING -PLACE EXAMPLE, the boundary is made of a window, a table, and a place where brushes and paints are on the left of the table.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">It should be mentioned that Each part of what you do when you are working, is essentially a center. For example, if you spend a lot of time talking one-on-one with a single client (attorney-client relationship), then it is the space that the two of you form together that is the principal center. It may consist of two chairs, perhaps a table or a desk, perhaps associated stuff you need to talk about. In any case, the efficiency of the way you can talk with your client, depends on the extent to which this center is a concentrated focus, and really works as a strong center.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">The same is true of the computer in your office. If it is important, then your workstation, the chair, the keyboard, the discs within easy reach, a surface for the mouse - all this forms a center. Once again, the center is comfortable and efficient, to the extent this center really is a strong, harmonious center. The levels of chair, screen, keyboard, mouse, each with its best hheight, may be the essence of what makes it comfortable.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">In your list of activities, it is probably the top three or four that play the key role in the way your office needs to work for you, and will therefore create the essence of your office.</font></p>
        <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">One point is very important in your ideal, key centers. There is one main center, the first one, and a number of secondary centers - the remaining ones. However, you should be aware that even though there usually is one center that you experience as the "main" center for your office, still, your work changes from day to day, and you may make the rounds in your office. One day the so-called main center may indeed be your main focus of activity. Another day a second one may play the main role. Another day it may be a third one. You need to visualize all these centers as part of a small group of centers, which give you your arena for work - and among which one is, often, but not always, the "main center".</font></p>
        <p><font size="+2" face="Times New Roman">The list of key centers which you have defined should give an accurate and general picture of the way your own office really needs to be. It should be a complete map of the essential character of your work habits, and your ideal office.</font></p>
