              <font color="brown">PART 2 -- BECOMING PART OF NATURE</font>
            </center>
            <p><font color="brown">For three hundred years, people have been inspired by nature. This began with the romantic appreciation of nature in the 17th century; it went on to Thoreau and Emerson, and to the great 20th-century naturalists and ecologists like the Carson, Odum and Aldo Leopold.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">In all this time, and continuing today, the theme of this appreciation of nature is inspired by the idea that we -- the creators of roads and towns and buildings -- destroy nature: hence that the beautiful unspoiled, magnificent natural structure we think of as "nature in the wild" can be rescued, preserved, only by conservation, preservation, and rigid application of what nature is.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">This has led to such theories as pure ecology (keep it as it was, at all costs), the native plants movement in California, the idea that wild grasses and shrubs should come right up to the wall of a house, as was sometimes practiced by ecologically-minded people in the 1970s in California.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">However, the underlying philosophy is flawed.</font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font color="brown">It rests on the assumption, first of all, that human beings are destined to be destructive, and that the beauty we know as nature can only be obtained by keep nature separate from men and women.</font></li>
              <li><font color="brown">It rests on the assumption that indeed there is such a thing as a wild natural system.</font></li>
              <li><font color="brown">It ignores the fact that we human beings -- men, women, children, with all of human culture and society -- <i>are part of nature too</i>. We have arrived on earth. Our existence, is as much a part of the earth as the Pacific Ocean, or as the growth of grasslands and forests.</font></li>
              <li>
                <font color="brown">It rests, finally, on a misunderstanding of what nature <i>is</i>. It rests on primitive (19th-20th century) assumptions that nature is the stuff that God made, or the stuff that grows by biological means, from DNA; or simply that it is the world of plants and animals and birds and fish.</font>
                <p><font color="brown">We love nature, and it is therefore essential to understand more accurately <i>what</i> it is that we love. I believe the quality which we love in nature is not the accident of biological structure. It is, rather, the truthful unfolding of a system, in a way that creates living structure.</font></p>
                <p><font color="brown">Thus everything that I have defined in THE NATURE OF ORDER is the thing that we truly appreciate as nature. It is that structure which is true, harmonious, relaxed as a system, wholesome, entire, filled with deep feeling, structurally and dynamically living.</font></p>

                </center>
                <p><font color="brown">This quality has, in the past been attained by some traditional societies -- certainly the gardeners and builders of the zen tradition come to mind; so, too, the Nubians in the Egyptian desert, the lands and villages and towns of many traditional builders. But we, in our civilization, have all but forgotten what this means, and have certainly not known -- in the last hundred years -- how to do it.</font></p>

                </center>
                <p><font color="brown">If I am right, that the creation of living process, and the use of living process to create living structure, is within our grasp, our picture of nature and what it means could be radically altered.</font></p>
