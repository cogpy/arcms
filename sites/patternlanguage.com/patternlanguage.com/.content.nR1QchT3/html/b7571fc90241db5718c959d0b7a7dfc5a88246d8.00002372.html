  Mon Feb 07, 2005 04:02 PM MST <b>Name and address:</b> Janice Oldham email:joldham@landam.com<b>Comments:</b> I am very excited to see the initatives being investigated and the preparations to really get our town involved as we move Duncanville into the 21st Century. What we are out to achieve is going back to the basics with the needs of creative and industrious people being met so they will set up shop and homes in our new fashioned town where YOU KNOW YOUR NEIGHBORS NAME and you both work, shop and play in Duncanville. I am ready to be a part of this venture. The vision is great now we move to the action. Main Street is the key to re-developing the spokes that radiate off of this hub. <b>Home town:</b> <b>Aspirations:</b><br>

Ross Taylor rtaylor@duncanvilleisd.org<b>Comments:</b> I love the idea of a pedestrian community of opportunities for shopping, eating, entertaining, visiting, etc. I also think the idea of the water features, lakes, etc has real merit. Radio controlled sailboats on one lake &amp; radio controlled power boats on another lake would give many hobby oriented people a unique venue. Lots of tables &amp; benches and unique beautiful (colorful lighting would enhance the landscape. I think flowering trees, shrubs, 7 perrenials &amp; annuals would go a long way to liven the atmosphere, particularly in large berms, planter boxes, &amp; hanging baskets. I love the ideas on your website, but couldn't access the 253 patterns. <b>Home town:</b> <b>Aspirations:</b><br>
