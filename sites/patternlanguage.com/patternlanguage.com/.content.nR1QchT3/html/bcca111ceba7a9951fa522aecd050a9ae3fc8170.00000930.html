  <b>THE ATOMS OF ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURE</b><br>
  Christopher Alexander and Barry Poyner</p>
  <p>The following papers are about design programming. They describe a new basic unit for the design of the environment. The unit is called a relation. It is a statement about the physical organisation which is required in a building if it is to function well. The papers show that a relation can be derived from a new concept of need, which is expressed in terms of a conflict. A relation is the physical organisation required to prevent a conflict.</p>
  <p>There are three papers. Together, they describe and illustrate relations. The first paper deals with the theoretical aspects. It explains the idea of expressing needs in terms of conflicts, and shows how relations are derived. The second and third papers are examples containing a number of relations. Each example is a simple design programme.</p>
  <p>The relations in the examples are deliberately restricted to small relatively self-contained complexes. One is the entrance to a house, and the other is the entrance to an office building. Two separate examples were written to enable the authors to prepare work independently, and to show that the ideas are equally applicable to more than one problem. The examples are not based on elaborate research, their essential purpose is to show how varied relations can be and how far environmental structure can be specified by them.</p>
  <p>The papers were prepared in the Directorate of Development, Ministry of Public Building and Works, London, during 1965-66. Christopher Alexander is an Associate Professor in the Department of Architecture at the University of California, and was employed as a consultant at the Ministry during a stay in England. Barry Poyner is an architect in the Directorate of Development.</p>
  <p>The authors wish to thank John Redpath, the Director of Development, and Ian Moore, for creating the opportunity for this work.</p>
  <p>The atoms of environmental structure are relations. Relations are geometrical patterns. They are the simplest geometrical patterns in a building which can be functionally right or wrong. A list of relations required in a building replaces the design programme (or brief), and the first stages of sketch design.</p>
  <p>INTRODUCTION</p>
  <p>At present, there are two things wrong with design programmes. First of all, even if you state clearly what a building has to do, there is still no way of finding out what the building must be like to do it. The geometry of the building is still a matter for the designer's intuition; the programme doesn't help with the geometry.</p>
  <p>Secondly, even if you state clearly what the building has to do, there is no way of finding if this is what the building ought to do. It is possible to make up a very arbitrary programme for a building. There is, at present, no way of being sure that programmes are themselves not arbitrary; there is no way of testing what the programme says.</p>
  <p>As far as this second point goes, most designers would maintain that no programme can ever be made non-arbitrary. They would say that the rightness or wrongness of a programme is not a factual matter, but a moral one; it is not a question of fact, but a question of value. These people argue in the same way about the physical environment itself. They say that the environment cannot be right or wrong in any objective sense, but that it can only be judged according to criteria, or goals, or policies, or values, which have themselves been arbitrarily chosen.</p>
  <p>We believe this point of view is mistaken. We believe that it is possible to define design in such a way that the rightness or wrongness of a building is clearly a question of fact, not a question of value. We also believe that if design is defined in this way, a statement of what a building ought to do, can yield physical conclusions about the geometry of the building, directly. We believe, in other words, that it is possible to write a programme which is both objectively correct, and which yields the actual physical geometry of a building.</p>
  <p>We shall now describe this new kind of programme. Our argument will have three parts. First, we shall replace the idea of need with its operational counterpart - which we call a tendency. Second, we shall show that a single need, when operationally defined, makes no demands on the physical environment - and that the physical environment requires a specific geometry only to resolve conflicts between tendencies. Third, we shall show that once a conflict between tendencies is clearly stated, it is then possible to define the geometrical relation which is required to prevent the conflict, and to insist that this relation must be present in any building where the conflict can occur. Finally, we assert that the environment needs no geometrical organisation, over and above that which it gets from combinations of relations so defined.</p>
  <p><br>
  I. WHAT IS A NEED</p>
  <p>Let us begin with the kind of programmes which people write today. It is widely recognised that any serious attempt to make the environment work, must begin with a statement of user needs. Christopher Jones calls them performance specifications; Bruce Archer calls them design goals; in engineering they are often called design criteria; at the Building Research Station they are called user requirements; at the Ministry of Public Building and Works they have been called activities; they are often simply called "requirements" or "needs". Whatever word is used the main idea is always this: Before starting to design a building, the designer must define its purpose in detail. This detailed definition of purpose, goals, requirements or needs can then be used as a check list. A proposed design can be evaluated by checking it against the check list.</p>
  <p>But how do we decide that something really is a need? The simplest answer, obviously, is "Ask the client". Find out what people need by asking them. But people are notoriously unable to assess their own needs. Suppose then, that we try to assess people's needs by watching them. We still cannot be sure we know what people really need. We cannot decide what is "really" needed, either by asking questions, or by outside observation, because the concept of need is not well defined.</p>
  <p>At present the word need has a variety of meanings. When it is said that people need air to breathe, it means that they will die within a few minutes if they don't get it. When someone says "I need a drink", it means he thinks he will feel better after he has had one. When it is said that people "need" an art museum the meaning is almost wholly obscure. The statement that a person needs something has no well-defined meaning. We cannot decide whether such a statement is true or false.</p>
  <p>We shall, therefore, replace the idea of need, by the idea of "what people are trying to do". We shall, in effect, accept something as a need if we can show that the people concerned, when given the opportunity, actively try to satisfy the need. This implies that every need, if valid, is an active force. We call this active force which underlies the need, a tendency.</p>
  <p>A tendency, therefore, is an operational version of a need. If someone says that a certain need exists, we cannot test the statement, because we don’t know what it really claims. If someone says that a certain tendency exist, we can begin to test the statement.</p>
  <p>Here is an example. Suppose we say “People working in an office need a view”. This is statement of need. It can interpreted in many ways. Does it mean “ It would be nice if people in offices had views”? Does it mean “People will do better work if they have a view”? Does it mean “People say they want a view from their offices”? Does it mean “People will pay money to get a view from their offices”? There are so many ways of interpreting it, that the statement is almost useless. We don't know what it really says.</p>
  <p>But if we replace it, by the statement "People working in offices try to get a view from their offices", this is a statement of fact. It may be false; it may be true; it can be tested. It is a statement of a tendency. If observation shows that people in an office actively try to get those desks which command a view, it is clearly reasonable to say that they need the view. If, on the other hand, people make no effort to get a view, even when they get the chance, we shall naturally begin to doubt the need.</p>
  <p>Now, every statement of a tendency is a hypothesis. It is an attempt to condense a large number of observations by means of a general statement. In this sense, a statement of a tendency is like any scientific theory.</p>
  <p>Since a statement of a tendency is always a hypothesis - that is, a way of interpreting observations - we must try as hard as possible to rule out alternative hypotheses. Suppose we have observed that people in offices try to get desks near the window when they get the chance. It is possible to infer from this that they are trying to get a view. But we might equally well infer the existence of other tendencies. They could be trying to get more light, or better ventilation, or direct sunlight. Or they may be trying to get something far more complicated; they may want to be in a position, from which they see the light on the faces of their companions - instead of seeing these companions in silhouette against the window.</p>
  <p>In order to be confident that people really seek a view, we must make observations which allow us to rule out such alternative interpretations, one by one. For example, suppose we construct an office in which light levels are uniform throughout, because windows are supplemented by artificial light. Do people still try to work near the window in such an office? If they do, we can rule out the possibility that they are merely trying to get more light.</p>
  <p>Ruling out all the alternative interpretations we can think of, is a laborious and expensive task. Furthermore, in order to make the hypothesis more accurate, we must try to specify just exactly what kind of people seek a view from their offices, during what parts of their work they seek it most, just what aspects of "view" they are really looking for..... Again, this is a laborious and expensive task. It is like the task of forming any scientific hypothesis. A good hypothesis can't be invented overnight; it can be created only by refinement over many years, and by many independent, different observers.</p>
  <p>It is, therefore, vitally important that we do not exaggerate the pseudo-scientific aspects of the concept of tendency. Since a tendency is a hypothesis, no tendency can be stated in any absolute or final form. The ideal of perfect objectivity is an illusion - and there is, therefore, no justification for accepting only those tendencies whose existence has been "objectively demonstrated". Other tendencies, though they may be speculative, are often more significant from the human point of view. It would be extremely dangerous to ignore such tendencies, just because we have no data to "support" them. Provided they are stated clearly, so that they can be shown wrong by someone willing to undertake the necessary experiments, it is as important to include these tendencies in the programme, as it is to include those tendencies which we are sure about.</p>
  <p><br>
  II. CONFLICTS</p>
  <p>We now face the central problem of design. Given a statement of what people need, how can we find a physical environment which meets those needs?</p>
  <p>In order to answer this question we must first define clearly just what we mean by meeting needs. This is not as easy as it seems. So long as we are using the word need, the idea of meeting them seems fairly obvious. However, once we replace the idea of need by the idea of tendency, and try to translate the idea of meeting needs in the new language, we shall see that its meaning isn't really clear at all.</p>
  <p>The idea of needs is passive. But the idea of tendencies is highly active. It emphasises the fact that, given the opportunity, people will try to satisfy needs for themselves. When we try to interpret the idea of meeting needs in the light of this new emphasis, we see that it is highly ambiguous. To what extent are people expected to meet needs for themselves, and to what extent is the environment expected to do it for them?</p>
  <p>Take for example, a simple situation: a man sitting in a chair. He has various needs. He needs to shift his position every now and then, so as to maintain the circulation in his buttocks and thighs. If he is trying to read, he needs enough light to read by. If he sits in his chair long enough, he will need food or refreshment. He needs ventilation. Under normal circumstances, he is perfectly able to meet these needs for himself. But if we define a good environment as one which meets needs, we should logically be forced to design an environment which meets these needs for him. This conjures up an image of a man lying in an arm chair, food being fed to him mechanically, window opening automatically when the room gets stuffy, light being switched on automatically as evening comes, pads in the chair massaging his buttocks to keep the pressure from building up too much in any one place ......</p>
  <p>The image is absurd. It is absurd because the man is perfectly capable of meeting these needs for himself. Indeed, not only is he capable of meeting them for himself, but, for his own well being, it is almost certain that he should meet them for himself. Man is an adapting organism. A man who is no longer meeting his needs is no longer adapting. The daily, hourly, process of adapting is the process of life itself; an organism which is no longer adapting is no longer alive.</p>
  <p>It is, therefore, clear that a good environment is not so much one which meets needs, as one which allows men to meet needs for themselves. If we define a need as a tendency, as something which people are trying to do, then we must assume that they will do it whenever they get the chance. The only job which the environment has, is to make sure they get this chance.</p>
  <p>Now at first sight, it may seem that the argument leads to a dead end. Go back to the example of the man sitting in a chair. Under normal conditions each one of the tendencies which arises in this situation can take care of itself. The man can do everything for himself. There is no problem in the situation. The environment does not require re-design. If needs are defined as tendencies, and if tendencies are capable of taking care of themselves, then why does the environment ever require design by designers? Why can't tendencies always be left to take care of themselves? Why can't people be left to adapt to the environment and to shape their own environment as they wish, with the help of bricklayers, carpenters, electricians and so on. If tendencies are active forces, then people will presumably take action whenever the environment isn't satisfactory, and meet their own needs for themselves. Why does the environment need design? Why should designers ever take a hand at all?</p>
  <p>The answer is this. Under certain conditions, tendencies conflict. In these situations, the tendencies cannot take care of themselves, because one is pulling in one direction, and the other is pulling in the opposite direction. Under these kinds of circumstances, the environment does need design: it must be re-arranged in such a way that the tendencies no longer conflict.</p>
  <p>Let us go back once more to the man sitting in a chair. There are certain chairs, made of canvas slung between wire supports, in which you cannot move about at will, because your body always sinks to the lowest position, and is held there by the canvas. After sitting in one of these chairs for a few minutes you begin to feel uncomfortable; the pressure on certain parts of the body builds up, but you cannot move slightly to reduce this pressure. You try to shift position but you can't. At first sight it might seem that this is a case where a single tendency simply isn't being met. But this is not so. Indeed, the tendency to try to reduce the pressure on your body has a very simple outlet. You can simply get up and walk about. The trouble is, of course, that in many cases there will be another tendency operating which makes you want to stay sitting where you are (because you are talking to someone, or because you are in the middle of reading something). It is the conflict between your tendency to stay sitting where you are and your tendency to shift position, which makes a problem. In a properly designed chair, this conflict does not occur.</p>
  <p>We may, therefore, replace the simple-minded definition of a good environment as one which meets needs, by the following definition: A good environment is one in which no two tendencies conflict.</p>
  <p>Of course, the conflicts which occur in buildings and cities can be much more complicated than the one we have just described. There can be conflicts between tendencies within a single person, or between tendencies in different people, or between a tendency in one person and a tendency in a group, or between a tendency in a person and some larger tendency which is part of a mass phenomenon. But the principle is always the same. Provided that all the tendencies which occur can operate freely, and are not brought into conflict with other tendencies, the environment in which they are occuring is a good one. It follows then that the environment only requires design in order to prevent conflicts occuring. If we wish to specify the pattern which an environment ought to have, we must begin by identifying all conflicts between tendencies which might possibly occur in the environment.</p>
  <p>In summary: until we have managed to see design problems in terms of conflicts between tendencies, there is nothing for the designer to do. So long as we see nothing but isolated tendencies we must assume that they will take care of themselves. We have only succeeded in stating a design problem in a constructive way, at that moment when we have stated it as a conflict between tendencies. Since the tendencies in conflict may often be hidden, this is a difficult process which requires a deliberate and inventive search for conflicts.<br>
  <br>
  III. RELATIONS</p>
  <p>We design the environment, then, to prevent conflict. We must now start talking about the features of buildings which can help us do this. The features which cause and prevent individual conflicts are not concrete pieces like bricks, or doors, or roofs, or streets; they are geometrical relationships between such concrete pieces. We call these relationships, relations.</p>
  <p>Before describing how we invent a new relation, let us look at some examples of well- known relations. Here are five typical relations from a supermarket:</p>
  <p>1. Check out counters are near the exit doors.</p>
  <p>2. The stack of baskets and trolleys is inside the entrance, and directly in front of it.</p>
  <p>3. Meat and dairy refrigerators are at the back of the store, and all other goods on display are between these refrigerators and the check out counters.</p>
  <p>4. Display shelving has a tapering cross section, narrow at the top, and wider at the bottom.</p>
  <p>5. The store is glass fronted, with aisles running from front to back, at right angles to the street.</p>
  <p>These relations have become widely copied and typical of supermarkets, because each of them prevents some specific conflict. Here are the conflicts behind each of the five relations:</p>
  <p>1. Check out near exit doors. This relation prevents a conflict between the following tendencies:<br>
  a. Management has to keep all goods on the sales side of the check outs.<br>
  b. Management is trying to use every square foot of selling space.</p>
  <p>2. A pile of baskets or trolleys inside the entrance and directly in front of it. This relation prevents a conflict between the following tendencies:<br>
  a. Management tries to encourage shoppers to use baskets, so that they are not reluctant to pick up extra goods.<br>
  b. Shoppers tend to make as fast as possible for the goods, and are, therefore, likely to miss the baskets.</p>
  <p>3. Meat and dairy products at the back of the store, so that all goods are between these counters and the check outs. This relation prevents a conflict between the following tendencies:<br>
  a. Management tries to get every shopper to walk past as many goods as possible.<br>
  b. Shoppers visit meat and dairy sections almost every time they go to the supermarket.</p>
  <p>4. Display shelving with tapering cross section. so that even goods near the ground are clearly visible to shoppers. This relation prevents a conflict between the following tendencies:<br>
  a. People tend to walk around a supermarket without bending down constantly to look for goods.<br>
  b. People want to be able to find the goods they are looking for without having to ask where they are.</p>
  <p>5. Glass fronted supermarket with aisles running back from the street and at right angles to it. This relation prevents a conflict between the following tendencies:<br>
  a. The management is trying to give passers by a view of the entire inside of the supermarket, so as to draw them in.<br>
  b. If the supermarket is on a street most of the passers by are walking pest the front.</p>
  <p>A relation, then, is a geometrical arrangement which prevents a conflict. No relation can be regarded as necessary to a building, unless it prevents a conflict which will otherwise occur in that building. A well designed building is one which contains enough relations to prevent any conflicts occurring in it.</p>
  <p>So far we have discussed only known relations - those which exist already. How do we invent a new relation? Obviously, we start by stating a conflict. But how do we invent a relation which prevents the conflict? The key fact is this: tendencies are never inherently in conflict. They are brought into conflict only by the conditions under which they occur. In order to solve the conflict, we must invent an arrangement where these conditions don't obtain.</p>
  <p>Here is an example: where a public path turns round the corner of a building, people often collide. The following tendencies conflict:<br>
  a. People are trying to see anyone approaching them some distance ahead, so that they can avoid bumping into them without slowing down.<br>
  b. Going round a corner, people try to take the shortest path.</p>
  <p>At a blind corner the first tendency makes people walk well clear of the corner, the second makes them hug the corner. At a blind corner the tendencies conflict.</p>
  <p>Before we can invent an arrangement which prevents this conflict, we must find out exactly what makes these tendencies conflict. It is not possible to invent a geometrical arrangement which prevents the conflict, until we have identified the aspects of arrangement which cause the conflict. In our example, there are several aspects of blind corners which we can blame for the conflict: the fact that the corner is solid, the fact that the corner is square, the fact that the ground is unobstructed around the corner.</p>
  <p>To eliminate the conflict we must get rid of one or more of these features. If we make the corner transparent, not solid, people will be able to see through it, and can, therefore, see far enough ahead. If we round the corner with a gradual curve, people will be able to see round the corner. If we place a low obstruction at the corner, like a flower tub, people will have to walk around it, and will see each other over the top of it.</p>
  <p>It is plain from the example that there are certain arrangements which cause the conflict, and certain "opposite" arrangements which prevent the conflict. These two classes of arrangement are mutually exclusive. Our task, given any conflict, is to define the class of arrangements which prevents the conflict. This is always difficult. In theory the class is infinite; even in practice it is very large. We must, therefore, define the class abstractly. We must define an abstract geometric property, shared by all arrangements in the class, and by no others. This is what we mean by a relation. A relation is a precise geometric definition of the class of arrangements which prevent a given conflict. It must be so worded as to include all the arrangements that do prevent the conflict, and exclude all those which cause it.</p>
  <p>Let us continue our example. We have described certain arrangements which cause a conflict at corners, and others which prevent the conflict. Those which prevent it include: a corner made of transparent material, a rounded corner, a tub of flowers so placed that people have to walk clear of the corner. What is the common property which all these good arrangements have, and which the bad arrangements lacks? Roughly speaking, the property is this:</p>
  <p>If we define a path round the corner at a distance of one foot out from all walls and objects which stick up above the ground, and examine all chords on this path which are less than fifteen feet long, we shall find that none of these chords are, at eye level, obstructed by anything opaque.</p>
  <p>This is the relation which prevents the conflict. In a building which contains this relation at all its corners, the conflict will not occur.</p>
  <p>The conflict in this example happens to be a simple one. However, even when the conflicting tendencies are much larger in scale, or more subtle, the logic is the same. We state the conflict, give examples of arrangements which cause and prevent it, and then try to abstract the relation which defines the latter class.</p>
  <p>Two minor points remain. First, conflicting tendencies occur under specific conditions. The relation required to prevent these tendencies conflicting, is only required under these specific conditions. The conditions under which the conflicting tendencies occur, must be stated as part of the relation. Thus, the final form of a relation will always be: "If such and such conditions hold, then the following relation is required".</p>
  <p>Second, the actual process of inventing a relation will not follow the process of finding conflicts and defining relations in strict sequence, as it has been presented here. In practice, the statement of tendencies, the statement of conflict, and the statement of the relation, all develop together.</p>
  <p>Let us summarise what we have done. We have described a process which has two steps:</p>
  <p>1. Identifying a conflict.</p>
  <p>2. Deriving a relation from it.</p>
  <p>This process for obtaining a relation is objective in the sense that each of its steps is based on a hypothesis which can be tested. The two hypotheses are: 1. Under certain specific conditions, such and such potential conflicting tendencies occur. 2. Under these conditions, the relation R is both necessary and sufficient to prevent the conflict.</p>
  <p>If we cannot show that either of these hypotheses are false, we must then assume that any building where the conflict can occur must contain the relation specified.</p>
  <p>In order to create a building in which no tendencies conflict, the designer must try to predict all the conflicts that could possibly occur in it, define the geometric relations which prevent these conflicts, and combine these relations to form a cohesive whole.</p>
  <p><br>
  IV. THE SCIENTIFIC ATTITUDE TO RELATIONS</p>
  <p>The point of view we have presented is impartial. This is its beauty. Because it is impartial, it makes possible a sane, constructive, and evolutionary attitude to design. It creates the opportunity for cumulative improvement of design ideas. Everything hinges on one simple question: What does a designer do when faced with a relation which someone else has written?</p>
  <p>The traditional point of view about design says that the rightness and wrongness of a relation is a question of value. A designer with this point of view will claim that a relation can only be judged by subjectively chosen criteria or values. Since people value things differently we can never be certain that one designer will accept another designer's opinion, and there is, therefore, no basis for universal agreement. With this point of view the cumulative development of design ideas is impossible.</p>
  <p>Our point of view is different. We believe that all values can be replaced by one basis value: everything desirable in life can be described in terms of the freedom of people's underlying tendencies. Anything undesirable in life - whether social, economic, or psychological - can always be described as an unresolved conflict between underlying tendencies. Life can fulfil itself only when people's tendencies are running free. The environment should give free rein to all tendencies; conflicts between people's tendencies must be eliminated.</p>
  <p>In terms of this view, the rightness or wrongness of a relation is a question of fact. Either the relation does prevent a conflict between tendencies which occur or it does not.</p>
  <p>As we have said, each relation is based on two hypotheses:</p>
  <p>1. That the conflicting tendencies do occur as stated, under the conditions specified.</p>
  <p>2. That the relation proposed is both necessary and sufficient to prevent the conflict between these tendencies.</p>
  <p>Faced with a relation stated in this form, the designer has two choices: either he must accept it, or he must show that there is a flaw in one of the hypotheses. Whatever he does, he cannot merely reject the relation because he doesn't like it.</p>
  <p>The body of known relations must, therefore, grow and improve. Design, if understood as the invention and development of relations, is no longer merely a collection of isolated and disconnected efforts. It becomes a cumulative scientific effort.</p>

  <a name="26relations" id="26relations"></a> <b>TWENTY-SIX RELATIONS FOR A SUBURBAN HOUSE</b><br>
  by Christopher Alexander<br>
  <br>
  <br>
  This paper describes twenty-six relations which must be present in the entrance to a single family house, standing on its own private lot, in a suburban street.</p>
  <p>Each relation is a geometric relation between specified physical elements. Each relation is necessary, in the sense that a predictable conflict will occur, and recur, during the life of the house, if the relation is missing.</p>
  <p>These twenty-six relations do not form a perfectly selfcontained complex. The circumstances which surround any one particular kind of housing may require only some of these twenty-six relations; or they may require extra ones. The twenty-six relations must be thought of as a kit of parts, which are to be put together differently in different conditions.</p>
  <p>It is therefore important to specify the precise conditions under which each individual relation is necessary. Given a real world building, and knowledge of the circumstances which surround it, it is possible to decide exactly which of the twentysix relations it must contain. This detailed specification of conditions will accompany the discussion of each individual relation. Meanwhile, here is a very rough outline of the circumstances these relations are designed for:</p>
  <p>The relations all apply to the entrance of a single detached suburban house, containing a single nuclear family, with or without children; it is assumed that the family owns at least one car, and that their way of life is some version of that found commonly in middle income suburbs in the United States (and, more recently, in England).</p>
  <p>I assume that the house stands on a street carrying fairly light traffic; I assume further that the house contains a kitchen, some kind of living-room, and that these rooms contain windows. These elements are not being questioned. The question of whether the street should have sidewalks or not, whether the kitchen should be closed or open, whether there should be one living-room or two, whether windows should have built-in curtains, or whether any of these elements should exist at all - none of these questions are being asked.</p>
  <p>This does not mean that streets, kitchens, living-rooms, windows are right as we now know them. Above all, it does not mean that one-family suburban houses are a good idea. They are very likely not. But discussion of these elements would be fruitless without deep analysis of the relations which define them. Even if the problem were allowed to expand outwards to cover these relations, it would still be incomplete, and its size would make it even weaker at the edges than it is now. I have, therefore, deliberately restricted the problem, to avoid the dangers of unlimited expansion. We shall assume that all relations except those entrance relations explicitly being questioned, remain as we now know them.</p>
  <p>This has an obvious consequence. The twenty-six relations defined here only apply for certain houses whose other defining relations are those normal for suburban houses in 1966. As soon as the relations which now define suburban houses suburban streets, windows, kitchens, living-rooms - are changed, then the entrance relations presented here will have to be re-examined. It is impossible to predict how many of them will be stable under the impact of such changes. However, I believe that many of these entrance relations will still be required, even after considerable change of the surrounding relations. To this extent these twenty-six relations do form an isolable, independent, complex.</p>
  <p>In order to show how the twenty-six different relations are themselves interrelated, they are all shown embedded in a single generic entrance plan. This plan, shown below, was reached by combining all twenty-six relations. Although there may possibly be other ways of combining the twenty-six relations, I have not been able to find one which is fundamentally different. If I am right, and there is indeed no other way of combining the relations, then this plan (up to certain allowable transformations) is a necessary consequence of the relations, and is required in order to avoid the various conflicts described.</p>

  </table>If a stranger is looking for the house, driving he is trying to make the following conflicting adaptations:<br>
  a. He is trying to maintain a reasonable speed on the road, say 25-30 mph, both to save time, and not to inconvenience other drivers.<br>
  b. He is trying to identify the house without getting out of his car.<br>
  c. He is trying to see the number far enough ahead so that he can slow down without overshooting, and if necessary, turn into the driveway.
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  Numbers which are too small to see from a distance.<br>
  A sign which is parallel to the road (on the house face, or garden gate), so that it can't be seen from up the street.<br>
  A sign which is at right angles to the street since this can't be read from that part of the street right in front of the house.<br>
  On a two way street, a sign which faces one way only, since the driver may be coming down the street from either direction.</p>
  <p>At 30 mph, under average road conditions the safe stopping distance is 245 feet. (R. L. Moore and A. W. Christie, Research on Traffic Signs, Engineering for Traffic Conference, Road Research Laboratory, July 1963, 113-122, see the formula on p. 117.) Furthermore, it will take about 2 seconds to read the number, or 88 feet at 30 mph (Ibid. p. 113). The sign must therefore be legible 333 feet from the house. For 99% of all drivers to be able to read it, the numbers must be 12" high to be legible at 333'. (Davey, J.B. The vision of a group of drivers, Brit. J. Physiol Optics, April 1958.)</p>
  <p>Further, so that these numbers are legible from either direction, and from the front, they must be placed at an angle to the street, (say between 45 and 70 degrees), one facing each direction.</p>
  <p>At present houses containing this relation are very rare. However, as soon as these relations become widely accepted, a new factor will come into play: drivers will read the sequence of house numbers, and slow down as they approach the one they want: under these conditions it will not be necessary to see the number quite so far ahead, and the numbers may be reduced in size: say to 6". The other relations will be unaffected.</p>

  </table>If the house numbers are too far back from the street, or too high in the air, or low enough to be obscured by parked cars, the driver looking for the house is trying to make two conflicting adaptations:<br>
  a. He is trying to find the house number without slowing down or getting out of his car.<br>
  b. He is trying to keep his eyes on the road ahead.
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  Signs low enough to be obscured by parked cars in front of them.<br>
  Signs high enough to make the driver crane his neck forward - for a normal car, close to a sign, anything higher than 10' may have this effect.<br>
  Any sign more than 10 degrees off the drivers path at the moment when it is being read.<br>
  (It has been established that a driver can maintain his course safely while looking at signs, provided that the signs are within 10 degrees of his path. (R. L. Moore and A. W. Christie, op. cit. 113-114).</p>
  <p>Even if the sign is large, the driver may not see the sign until he is close to it. The sign must therefore be as close to the street as possible, so as not to violate the 10 degree limit.</p>
  <p>If there is any private land between the sign, and those parts of the street from which the sign is supposed to be visible, trees or outhouses may get put up there in the course of the years, and obscure the sign. The sign must therefore be on the property line which divides the street from private property.</p>

  </table>Many suburban families have two cars: people go to the suburbs to raise children, and the wife needs a car during the day. Even if the family itself has only one car, most visitors will come by car: for one reason or another, there will often be more than one car in front of the house.
  <p>The following conflict can arise:<br>
  a. Drivers always take their cars as close to the house as the remaining space permits.<br>
  b. Drivers try to place their cars so that they won't have to go out to move the car when someone else is trying to leave.<br>
  c. Drivers want to be able to leave without having to disturb the owners of other cars.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict:<br>
  Single width driveway - where one car always gets boxed in by another.<br>
  More generally, any kind of driveway which is more than two cars long, thus giving one car room to box another in.</p>
  <p>4. <u>Driveway entrance flared at a tangent to the nearside lane, and at about 70 degrees to the offside lane. Car parking positions at the end of simple arcs, tangent to the nearside and center of the street respectively, according to direction of approach</u>.</p>

  </table>This relation depends strongly on the conditions in which it occurs. It depends especially on three factors: the width of the lot, the amount of traffic on the street, and the relative number of connections in the street network near the house. I shall assume that the lot is too narrow to allow a car to turn on the lot itself (i.e. 60' or less); that there is only light traffic on the street outside, so that backing into the street is safe, provided that the driver can see the street as he backs into it; and that the street network is dense - so that if the driver arrives from one direction he can leave without turning the car round, and still take any overall direction in the city without making a large detour. These conditions are characteristic of most new housing developments in the suburban parts of large urban areas. Under these conditions the following tendencies conflict:<br>
  a. Drivers try to drive the car as close to the door as possible.<br>
  b. Drivers will drive the car to that standing position which is easiest to drive to: they will try to sweep off the street in a continuous smooth curve, without reversing the steering wheel.<br>
  c. Drivers will drive the car to a position from which they can easily back out and manoeuvre, with a clear view of the street.
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  A long narrow driveway at right angles to the street.<br>
  A driveway with a narrow entrance, or gateposts, which force the driver to slow down excessively as he drives in, and prevent the driver seeing the street when he backs out.<br>
  The traditional "carriageway" pattern which is too tight on a narrow lot, with the results that cars are left standing in the entrance part because they cannot negotiate the loop comfortably.<br>
  Any driveway so placed that the driver has to negotiate a curve of radius less than about 40 feet, which is the least curve a car can cope with comfortable at 15-20 mph.</p>
  <p>The pattern required is clearly asymmetrical. The arc drawn from the nearside of the street must be tangent to the nearside of the street. The arc drawn from the offside of the street must be tangent to the center of the street, and will cut the property line at about 45 degrees (given a street whose center line is 15 feet from the property line, and a 40 foot radius arc).</p>

  <p>The following tendencies conflict:<br>
  a. People getting in and out of cars try to open the car door to a full right angle.<br>
  b. Drivers drive car as close to door or entrance as they can squeeze it.<br>

  </table>This relation is intended to replace the "Kitchen door front door" dichotomy. It does not deal with the need for openings leading direct from living rooms or bedrooms into the garden, nor with garbage disposal, nor with the fact that teenagers may need private entrances leading straight to their own rooms. These needs depend too much on the internal organisation of the house to be discussed in this paper.
  <p>The "kitchen door - front door" dichotomy, still common in England, is a left-over from a time when social class made it necessary to have one entrance for owners and their guests, and another, separate, entrance for tradesmen and servants. The separation of the two has no purpose now, and causes conflict between the following adaptive tendencies:<br>
  a. Both family and visitors tend, more and more, to come and go by car. Since people try to use the most convenient door they use the door nearest the car (Mere Hole et al, Studies of . 800 houses in conventional and Radburn layouts, BRS Garston 1966).<br>
  b. People try to drive the car close to kitchen after shopping (especially with increased use of supermarkets, and huge packages, and close to living room when they are with family or friends, or visiting someone else.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict:<br>
  A house planned so that the living room is most accessible from a front door, and the kitchen from a back door; since the cars always have some constant, most natural, parking position, either the kitchen is inconveniently placed, or else the living room is inconveniently placed.<br>
  Example: Radburn type plan - where back door faces parking lot, and front door faces "pedestrian" green area. For families with cars, and back door, being on the car park side, dominates exit and entry, yet visitors are "supposed" to come to the front door.</p>

  a. Strangers are trying to find the "right" door.<br>
  b. People walking along, if they are going to turn off a street, have a natural impulse to turn off at the first opportunity which seems to go in the right direction. (Tyrus Porter, A study of path-choosing behaviour, Thesis, Department of Architecture, University of California, Berkeley, 1964: section titled "South campus entrance").<br>
  c. People try to go "straight" to their destination, without backtracking, hesitations, mistakes, and waste of time.<br>
  d. Visitors preparing for an encounter are often emotionally concentrated, are trying to prepare for the coming meeting, and do not want to be distracted by the need to search consciously for the "right" door.

  </table>Many house plans are so organised as to cause a conflict between the following two tendencies, with the result that the second adaptation cannot be made:<br>
  a. People do not want the inside of their houses to be visible from the street.<br>
  b. To avoid the abruptness of encounters, people like to see who is coming before they reach the door.
  <p>There is ample evidence for the fact that people like to know who is coming, before they actually hear the door bell ring. In the United States, where almost everybody has a phone, it has become common courtesy to call ahead: people like to know who's coming in advance. Knocking on doors before you enter, is a widely accepted habit throughout the Western world: it gives the person inside a chance to adjust himself, mentally, for the coming encounter.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  Windows which look out on the front, but are visible from the street, thus forcing people to curtain them, and to live away from these windows.<br>
  Path to front door doesn't pass windows of living areas.</p>
  <p>The front of the house must be so laid out that the paths to the door are visible from windows, but the street itself is not: this means that there must be some kind of obstruction placed near the street end of the path or paths, with the relation to the windows shown opposite.</p>

  a. The person answering the door often tries to see who is at the door before they open it. For instance, Banhams Patent Docks, Kensington High Street, London, report a 50% increase in the sales of domestic door viewers between 1963 and 1965. The anonymous nature of the metropolis, and the possibility of unwelcome callers, makes the need acute. Many people, if they have a convenient window, also make a slight detour when they hear the doorbell ring, to see who is outside.<br>
  b. People do not want to go out of their way to peer at people on the doorstep, partly because it is too much trouble, and partly because they don't want to make it obvious that they are appraising the visitor.,br&gt; c. If the people meeting are old friends, they seek chance to shout out, wave, etc, in anticipation.<br>
  d. If the visitor seems unwelcome or dangerous, a woman alone especially, wants to be able to talk to him without opening the door.<br>
  e. Since it takes a few seconds to adjust mentally and posturally to an encounter, people answering the door, may want a second or two, unseen, after they know who is at the door, before they open it, and before they can be seen.
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  An entrance in which there are no clear glass windows at all.<br>
  An entrance in which the first view of the visitor which the insider has, is through the door itself, so that he has no time to prepare.<br>
  An entrance such that nearest window is off the natural path to door.<br>
  A window which looks straight at the visitor on the doorstep from the front.<br>
  Windows which are unopenable, so that the lone woman is forced to open the door in order to talk to the visitor.<br>
  An all glass entrance.<br>
  A window so placed that because of privacy it gets a curtain hung in front of it, and the curtain has to be pulled back to see through.<br>

  </table>The following tendencies conflict:<br>
  a. In a city, people tend to place entrances far enough back off the public street, so that passers-by cannot approach the house or touch it casually, but can only approach it closely if they first declare themselves as visitors: the inhabitants want to be able to identify a loiterer or trespasser at once, without having to ask what they are doing.<br>
  b. People try to mark the area outside the entrance, to identify it clearly as "theirs". In British New Towns people are unwilling to go without a front garden, even though they do not use the garden to sit in; nor are they willing to have the garden maintained by the council (Cyril Bird, Reactions to Radburn, a study of Radburn type housing in Hemel Hempstead RIBA final thesis, 1960) 90% of inhabitants said the front garden, which was 21 feet deep, was just right or too small - yet only 15% ever used it for sitting in. 77% rejected the idea that the front garden be maintained for them by the council. The inference seems clear: people want the right to control and decorate the area in front of their houses. Much of the decoration round the front of a house - pots, plants, mosaics, hanging lanterns, colored glass, fancy brass knockers, pottery gnomes, is apparently intended to mark the entrance as private and "belonging" to the people inside. It is perhaps worth adding that there is little evidence to support the belief that people want to keep cars out of sight. For many people the car they own is an object of pride, and an important part of the display around the front.<br>
  c. People tend not to use the front garden for sitting in, since it is in full public view.<br>
  d. People also try not to waste land - they want to get the most use out of their land that they can.
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict among these tendencies are:<br>
  A door which opens straight on to a public street: Park Hill housing, or Blackheath housing, (this relation causes no conflict in a rural village, where tendency a. does not occur).<br>
  Any door which leaves no private space around the outside which can be marked as personal, and any building in which occupants are not allowed to decorate the area round the front.<br>
  A wide lot, wastes valuable land, in order to set the building well back from the road.</p>
  <p>Example: The common town house pattern, where the basement area, even though only about 6' deep, cuts the house off from the street, and the step in front of the front door, is clearly private, and people c an step on it only if they intend to enter.</p>

  </table>The following tendencies conflict:<br>
  a. On the street people adopt a mask of "street behaviour"; the momentum of this mask tends to persist until wiped clean.<br>
  b. Arriving home, people search for the security of an inner sanctum, where they can relax completely.<br>
  c. Those arriving at a house seek as much "contact" with the people inside as possible.
  <p>The first of these tendencies clearly conflicts with the other two. People who are still in a street mood, maintain the general level of "closedness", tension and distance, which is appropriate to public encounters; and they are thereby prevented from relaxing, or from opening up sufficiently to meet people with maximum contact.</p>
  <p>Evidence for the first tendency comes from the report: Serge Bouterline and Robert Weiss, The Seattle Worlds Fair, Cambridge Mass 1963. The authors noticed that many exhibits failed to "hold" people; people drifted in, and then drifted out again within a very short time. However, in one exhibit people had to cross a huge, deep-pile, bright orange carpet on the way in: in this case, though the exhibit was no better than other exhibits, people stayed. The authors concluded that people were, in general, under the influence of their own "street and crowd behaviour", and that while under this influence could not relax enough to make contact with the exhibits; but that the bright carpet presented them with such a strong contrast as they walked in, that it broke the effect of their outside behaviour, in effect "wiped them clean", with the result that they could then get absorbed in the exhibit.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause the conflict are:<br>
  Any kind of environmental continuity between street and house which supports continued street behaviour.<br>
  For instance:<br>
  Houses where the asphalt of the sidewalk continues unbroken up to the front door.<br>
  Houses where the inside of the house is at the same level as the street, with no change of level in between.<br>
  Houses in which living rooms have the same view as from the street outside.</p>
  <p>I suspect that a step down into a living room, helps destroy the street mask, because of the strong sense of stability and arrival which it creates.</p>

  d. People try to keep the front of the house tidy.
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  A normal garage: junk gets piled against the interior walls, with the result that people can no longer get in and out of the car when it is standing in the garage, so the car is left outside.<br>
  A half-open garage like an enclosed car car port: the junk still piles up: though it is less of a nuisance for circulation, it is now visible from the street.<br>
  A car port with no sides at all, does not protect the car against wind-driven rain.<br>
  The sides to the car port must therefore be closed above 4', so that rain cannot be driven in, but open at ground level, so there are no walls to pile junk up against.<br></p>

  c. People tend to "live" away from the street, or, if they do live on the street side, tend to keep windows closed to give themselves acoustic privacy, and to cut out street noise.

  a. People try to shelter from the rain, wind and cold, while waiting.<br>
  b. People stand near the door while they are waiting for it to open.<br>
  c. People try to stand with their backs against a wall when they are waiting.
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  No roof outside the entrance.<br>
  No overhang on the roof, thus allowing wind driven rain into the porch.<br>
  Covered area too small, so that a group of people can't all fit under it: allowing 5 square feet per person, and assuming that groups arriving will rarely have more than five people, the covered area must be at least 25 square feet.<br>
  Covered area long and thin, so that people have to stand behind one another, and can't directly face the door, or all be seen at once by the person who answers the doors: area must be roughly square in shape.<br>
  Cold is caused largely by air movement: any porch which fails to provide windbreaks is thus liable to cause the conflict. Even a three sided porch may allow wind to blow in: most effective of all is a porch whose sides turn around, and form an almost entirely enclosed area.<br>

  a. Person tries to hold onto package, tries to keep it upright, clean, off the ground, and within reach.<br>
  b. At the same time this person tries to get both hands free to hunt through pockets or handbag for key, turn key in the lock, turn the door handle, and put the key away again.
  <p>When a person is leaving the house, with a package, two conflicts can come into play. One is the same as that described above. The other is between the following tendencies:<br>
  c. People mean to take a certain package with them when they leave.<br>
  d. At the moment of leaving people tend to be preoccupied with other things, (and this makes them forget the package which they meant to take).</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause these conflicts are:<br>
  No surface on which to rest a package, inside the door.<br>
  No surface on which to rest a package outside the door.<br>
  No surface on which to slide the package through the door.<br>
  The shelf on the hinge end of the door, and therefore too far from the latch to be useful.<br>
  Shelf too low, so that person has to bend down so far to rest the package, that he can't reach the latch or keyhole.</p>
  <p>In order to avoid the conflict there must be a shelf on both sides of the door at about waist height, so that the person going through the door can support a package with his free arm, or with his body, while he opens the door. Further, so that the person can open the door, get himself and the package through the door, and close the door, without losing control of the package, the shelf must be right through the door opening as shown below. So that the shelf doesn't present any sharp corners to people going through the door, it must taper as shown; the door needs to be made with a notch out of it, as shown.</p>

  a. Politeness demands that when someone comes to the door, the door is opened wide, and if the housewife goes to fetch something, that the door be left open.<br>
  b. People seek privacy for the inside of their houses: in particular, try to prevent people seeing the various kinds of mess that accumulate during the day while cleaning up is going on.<br>
  (Thus, for instance, when going to answer the door, many women try to close doors, close closets and clear things out of sight, on their way to the door).<br>
  c. The family, sitting talking, or at table, do not want to feel disturbed, or intruded upon, when someone comes to the door.
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>

  A door which opens in such a way that a person standing on the step can see into any room whose door is open.</p>

  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  Glazing placed in such a way that people on their way from bedroom to kitchen, living room or bathroom can be seen from the doorstep.</p>
  <p>People are reluctant to use clear glass in doors (Albert Haberer, Doors and gates, London 1964, pp.8,12). When clear glass is provided, if the inside rooms or movement are visible, people put curtains over the glass (Madge report, MPBW, p.12), and for a very dramatic example the Edward Barnes house. Although the living room seems to be screened from the entrance in fact the glass does look into the sides of the living room, and the path from the bedroom to the kitchen passes right past the glass. Inevitably the architect was forced to put curtains in as soon as the building went into use. (Record Houses, 1957, p.208).</p>
  <p>Although the inhabitants can avoid this conflict by putting up curtains or putting in obscure glass, when they do this, then the purpose of the clear glass as a way of seeing visitors (relation 10) is lost, and then those conflicts then crop up instead.</p>

  b. Same person tries to allow the other to go through the door first.<br>
  c. People try to continue conversations as they go through a door.
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  If the door itself is too narrow, or if the area immediately next to the door is too narrow, then the person cannot both open the door for someone else, and allow them to go through first: either they allow them to go first, and must then reach round them in the most awkward way to open the door for them; or they go ahead to open the door first, but cannot then stand aside to let the other through, with sufficient comfort to make it casual, graceful and polite. On the side the door swings into (inside), the conflict can be overcome only if there is clear floor area in an arc 2 feet beyond the swing of the door.</p>
  <p>In order to prevent the conflict between b and c, both the door itself, and the passages on either side of the door must be wide enough for two people to go through side by side: i.e. at least 3-4" wide.</p>
  <p>Outside the door, if there is a wall on the side where the latch is, running out at right angles to the door, and less than 21 from the door, there is no room for a person to stand, while someone else opens the door. This situation occurs in a simple recess, or if there is a shelf or parapet at right angles to the door.</p>

  </table>Hostesses do not like visitors to see into the kitchen. This is not universally true: it is obviously not true, for example, among people who entertain all visitors in the kitchen. It is also not true among "enlightened" liberals and bohemians: it remains true for a huge population of middle class families. In this case, the following conflict occurs:<br>
  a. Housewife tries to steer formal guests directly to the living room, and to prevent them seeing into the kitchen.<br>
  b. Kitchen doors get left open or taken down. This happens because during the day there is more traffic in and out of the kitchen than through any other door in the house.<br>
  (cf. R.G. Bateson, K, Jean Noble and J.J. Attenburrow, The house and housework RIBA journal, December 1954). Over a period of time, the door gets propped open; sooner or later the props become permanent; the door is taken down; or things get stood against the door - so that it remains permanently open. Even in the rare cases of kitchen doors which are still free, they are open so much of the time, that they are often open at the crucial moment when guests arrive.
  <p>Arrangements which cause this conflict are:<br>
  An open kitchen, directly connected to the formal living room.<br>
  A kitchen whose door faces onto the path from front door to formal living room.<br>
  A kitchen which opens off the living room.<br></p>
  <p>Although these arrangements cause conflict, they are permissible if the working surfaces are not visible. Though not relevant to the discussion of entrances, this is important: it means that a woman working in the kitchen can talk to her guests in the living room, and yet maintain the isolation of the "kitchen" that she requires, by having an open plan, in which all working surfaces are hidden from view.</p>

  <a name="poyner" id="poyner"></a> <b>RELATIONS FOR AN OFFICE ENTRANCE</b><br>
  Barry Poyner
  <p>There are, of course, many kinds of office building. Some are in cities, some are not. Some are large, high-rise buildings, some are low-rise and small. Some are occupied by one organisation, others are multi-let. Different kinds of office building create different kinds of entrance. For the sake of simplicity, the example considers an entrance to one particular kind of office building.</p>
  <p>It is the entrance to a medium sized high-rise office building. The building is on a busy city street, and has only one entrance. It is built right up to the pavement, so that the entrance opens directly onto the street. There is a receptionist on the ground floor.</p>
  <p>All the relations given in the example have been derived from conflicts which occur in this kind of entrance. If the entrance is changed in any way - if the building is set back from the street or there is no receptionist in the entrance - some of the relations will no longer apply. However, not all of the relations will have to be abandoned, some will apply to all office entrances. If the scope of the example was extended to include all the common entrance types, it would produce a store of relations, from which different sets could be chosen to suit the different conditions in different entrances.</p>
  <p>The example does not deal with every aspect of the organisation of the entrance. In general, the relations chosen for the example determine the arrangement of the pavement, entrance doors, lifts, reception desk and seats for visitors. They have been chosen because they seem to form a relatively self-contained system.</p>
  <p>It is assumed that the doors, lifts, desk and seats are all similar to those commonly used in entrances at present. In particular, the doors are assumed to be conventional side- hung rectilinear doors. All these objects are accepted as they are for the purpose of the example, although a more detailed study would almost certainly cause these objects, themselves, to change.</p>
  <p>Some of the relations that follow are well known to designers, but others are not. It is, partly, the intention of the paper to show that well known and generally accepted relations, such as relations 4, 7, 9, 14, can be derived from conflicts in exactly the same way as new relations.</p>
  <p>On the following page is an outline diagram of the organisation produced when all twenty-two relations are combined together.</p>
  <p>The diagram can be drawn in several ways without losing its validity. For example, the doorways need not be symetrical, indeed, the introduction of two separate outer doorways is quite arbitrary. The number of lifts is also arbitrary, and there is no reason why they should be in a straight line.</p>
  <p>If the organisation shown by the diagram was to be used in the design of an office building, it would have to be modified. It would have to be modified to fit together with other relation systems, and it would have to be modified to take account of building technology. Any modification is possible so long as no relation is omitted.</p>
  <table align="center">

    </tr>
  </table>The relations are discussed one by one. Each relation is set out on two facing pages. The first page contains a written definition of the relation and a diagram. The diagram is the same as the outline diagram facing this page, but with the relation under discussion boldly superimposed to show how it has been integrated with the other relations. It is important to emphasize that the written definition of the relation defines a class of arrangements. The diagram illustrating each relation only shows one of the arrangements within the class.
  <p>The second page explains how the relation is derived. The conflict is introduced in general terms, and then, the conflicting tendencies are formally stated. Any available evidence for a tendency is included immediately after its formal statement. The rest of the page attempts to define the two classes of arrangement; those which cause the conflict, and those which prevent it.</p>
  <p>1. <u>The parts of the building on the ground floor, adjacent to the entrance, must be set back to allow the entrance to project</u>.</p>
  <table align="center">

  </table>Some people coming to the building will be strangers. They will know roughly where the building is, and on which side of the street it is. Because the street is busy, they will cross to the correct side of the street well before approaching the entrance. But, the building is built right up to the pavement, so they will be looking along it at an acute angle, and may have difficulty seeing the entrance.
  <p>The following tendencies may conflict:</p>
  <p>a. People tend to approach the entrance at an acute angle, along the face of the building. People can only cross a busy street at certain places, such as an intersection or pedestrian crossing. They will, therefore, tend to cross to the correct side of the street, well before reaching the building.</p>
  <p>b. On a busy pavement, people try to work out their path some distance ahead, to preposition themselves to take the shortest path.<br>
  (See Tyros Porter, a study of path choosing behavior, thesis, University of California, Berkeley, 1964; in particular the study of the Kaiser Center lobby.)</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>If the entrance doors are recessed and there is no projection at the entrance, people approaching along the pavement will not be able to see the entrance. They will tend to move out to the outside edge of the pavement to see along the building more clearly. If they do this, they cannot preposition themselves to take the shortest path into the entrance, because they will have to bob and weave their way across the path of other pedestrians.</p>
  <p>If the entrance has a projecting canopy, people will not necessarily associate it with the entrance. If there is a low projection, like a step, people will not see it because it will be obscured by other pedestrians.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>Some projections wil1 prevent the conflict. A classical portico with columns in front of the entrance, or an entrance with a projecting lobby or revolving door, can be seen by people approaching the entrance at an acute angle. All these projections are roughly storey height.</p>
  <p>In this example, the building is built right up to the pavement, but the entrance cannot project onto the pavement, so to gain a projection, the parts of ground floor on either side of the entrance must be set back.</p>
  <p><br>
  2. <u>Covered space between entrance doors and payment, of which about 100 square fast is not immediately in front of the doors</u>.</p>

  </table>In Britain, particularly in London, people use umbrellas. When it rains, this relation is necessary to people arriving at the building or leaving it. However, for the sake of simplicity, only the problem of people arriving is discussed.
  <p>When it is raining, and people are entering the building from the street, the following tendencies may conflicts</p>
  <p>a. People try to get under cover before collapsing their umbrellas.</p>
  <p>b. People will stop to collapse their umbrellas before going through the entrance doors.</p>
  <p>c. People try to find a place to collapse their umbrellas away from the stream of passers- by on the pavement, and clear of the entrance doors.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>If there is no cover in front of the entrance doors, people have to collapse their umbrellas before they can get under cover. If there is cover but it is over the pavement, or it is limited to the space immediately in font of the doors, people will not be able to step aside from the stream of passers-by or stop clear of the entrance doors.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>The conflict does not occur where there is ample covered space in front of the entrance doors, or where there is also covered space to one side of the doors, providing it is not part of the pavement. Any arrangement of covered space between doors and pavement is possible, so long as a substantial part of it, say 100 square feet, is not immediately in front of the doors.</p>
  <p>3. <u>A covered linear recessed space. At the side of the entrance doors, about 2 feet deep, and roughly parallel to the street</u>.</p>
  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="poyner4.JPG" width="300"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>When it comes on to rain heavily, people in the street shelter for a while, hoping the rain will soon stop or at least become lighter. If the office entrance has covered apace outside the entrance doors, it provides ideal shelter, but if many people try to shelter, the entrance gets blocked up.
  <p>Where the entrance opens straight onto the pavement, the following three tendencies may conflicts</p>
  <p>a. When it comes on to rain. heavily, people on the pavement try to get under cover.</p>
  <p>b. People sheltering in an entrance, try to stand out of the way of other people going in and oat.</p>
  <p>c. While sheltering in an entrance, people tend to stand in a line facing the street.</p>
  <p>They will be facing the street to watch for the moment when the rain stops or becomes lighter. Also, it is characteristic of human behaviour, that people in crowds avoid standing face to face, they will tend to stand facing the same way.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>If the only cover is in front of the entrance doors, or on direct paths in and out of the entrance, then people cannot shelter without getting in the way. Even where there is a covered space at the side of the doors, if the doors are set back so that this space runs in at right-angles to the pavement from a narrow opening, people will not use it; they will tend to form a line across the opening facing the street, again blocking the entrance.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>Clearly, the arrangements which prevent a conflict will have some covered space at the side of the entrance doors, so that people can shelter without blocking the doorway. It must also be a recess to avoid being on any direct path in and out of the entrance. If this space was a deep recess, or a recess not parallel to the street, it would be wasted, because people will tend to stand in a line facing the street. The space must therefore be a shallow linear recess, roughly parallel to the street. A depth of 2 feet should be sufficient to allow a single line of people to shelter.</p>
  <p>Note: The length of this space is not known. it will depend on how busy the pavement is, whether or not there is a bus stop near by, and how much other shelter is available. The length shown on the diagram is no more than a guess.</p>

  4. <u>Paving in front of entrance doors laid to fall away from the entrance threshold</u>.</p>

  </table>When it rains, paddles may form outside the entrance doors, owning the following tendencies to conflicts
  <p>a. People try to take the shortest path into the entrance.</p>
  <p>b. People try to avoid stepping into paddles.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>This arrangement applies whether or not there is a canopy. Water is always trying to flow to a lower point, and therefore it can run in under a canopy, or can be blown in. People also carry water in on their feet. Any arrangement where the paving falls towards the doors, or where there is a low undrained point in font of the doors, will allow puddles to form, which will cause the conflict. This must also apply to nominally flat paving, because it will inevitably have some irregularities which hold water.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>To prevent puddles forming, the paving in front of the doors must have no low points. It must also have a slight fall to drain water from any irregularities of the surface The minimum effective fall will vary according to the nature of the surface. Common falls specified for public pavements are 1:32 and 1:48, but since the exact reasoning behind these ratios is not known, the relation does not specify a particular fall.</p>
  <p>5. <u>Space immediately inside the entrance, close to the doors and clear of all entry and exit paths with a direct view of the street</u>.</p>
  <p><br></p>
  <table align="center">
    <tr>
      <td><img src="poyner6.JPG" width="300"></td>
    </tr>
  </table>When it rains, some people will hang back in the entrance lobby, hoping that the rain will ease off. When it is cold and windy, people who are waiting to be picked up by car, will wait inside the entrance. In both cases, the people waiting may block the way of other people going in and out.
  <p>The following tendencies may conflicts</p>
  <p>a. In bad weather, people hang back or wait inside the entrance.</p>
  <p>b. People tend to wait at a point overlooking the street.</p>
  <p>They will want to know the moment the rain eases off, or when the car they are expecting arrives.</p>
  <p>c. The people who are waiting, try to keep out of the way of those who are going in and out.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflicts:</p>
  <p>If the only windows near the entrance doors are in the entrance doors themselves, people who are waiting will tend to crowd around the doors. Even if there is another window near the doors, if the space just inside of it, is close to any path in or out of the entrance, then again, people will get in the way. In both of these arrangements, people cannot stand by the window and at the same time keep out of the way.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>If the entrance lobby is large and surrounded by glass, the conflict will not occur. Indeed, any entrance with a space overlooking the street and near to the entrance doors, will prevent the conflict, provided the space is clear of in and out movement.</p>
  <p><br>
  6. <u>The entrance lobby sealed off from the rest of the building by self-closing close fitting doors, two sets of self-closing doors between the entrance lobby and pavement, reception desk well away from entrance doors</u>.</p>

  </table>Most likely the receptionist will be a woman. Women office workers tend to wear light clothing all year round. The receptionist will be no exception, she will want to dress in a similar manner to other women in the building. However, entrance lobbies are notoriously draughty and, as a result, are a source of many complaints.
  <p>If the entrance has conventional doors, in cold weather, the following tendencies may conflict:</p>
  <p>a. A receptionist seeks warmth and freedom from draughts. Many entrance lobbies have been observed with portable heaters and screens provided round the receptionist, as a result of complaints of cold and draught.</p>
  <p>b. People are going in and out of the entrance, and are therefore opening and shutting the entrance doors, throughout the day.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>It is the frequent opening and closing of doors which causes the conflict. If the entrance doors are not self-closing, or if they only form one set of doors between entrance lobby and street, there is bound to be trouble. If the receptionist is close to the doors, she will be more likely to suffer from draughts than if she was well away from them.</p>
  <p>There is a further kind of arrangement which causes conflict. If the entrance lobby opens directly onto an open staircase or corridor leading to a door on the other side of the building, then there is a strong tendency for through draughts to develop.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>To prevent the conflict, several features must be present together. If the entrance lobby is, as far as possible, sealed off from the rest of the building, the air pressure in the lobby tends to equalize with the air pressure outside, and so lessens the tendency for cold air to flow in. To reduce the opportunity for air to flow in, a double set of doors is necessary, so that there is a double seal between inside and outside.</p>

  <p>a. On entering, people tend to push open the entrance doors, so that they walk through without stopping, only slowing down to operate the door easily.</p>
  <p>b. Similarly, on leaving.</p>
  <p>c. People try to use the shortest path through the entrance, and therefore, the same door tends to be used for entering and leaving.</p>
  <p>This will happen no matter how many "IN" and "OUT" notices are put on doors.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>Where the entrance doors open either inwards or outwards only, people cannot push them open both when they enter and when they leave. If some of the doors open inwards, and some open outwards, people cannot use the same door when entering and leaving, without having to pull it open on their way in or out. Wherever some of the entrance doors open one way only, there will be a conflict.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>The simple converse of the arrangements which cause the conflict, will prevent it. No doors must open one way only. All doors must be made to open both inwards and outwards, so that people can push them open whether they are going in or out.</p>

  </table>Where there are swing doors in an entrance, unless people who use them can see anyone approaching the doors on the other side, accidents can happen.
  <p>The following tendencies may conflict:</p>
  <p>a. People tend to take the shortest path through the entrance, and therefore, tend to use the same door going in and out.</p>
  <p>b. People try to push open entrance doors, so that they walk through without stopping, only slowing down to operate the door easily.</p>
  <p>c. People try to avoid bumping other people. If people see each other coming from opposite sides of the doorway, they wall try to use different doors.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>If the doors are opaque, then people cannot see through them, and cannot avoid bumping someone on the other side of the door when they push it open. Single leaf doors also cause conflict, because if someone about to push open a door, sees someone else on the other side, there will be two people about to go through the door at the same time; one must give way and wait.</p>
  <p>Farther, even when doors are glazed, if there is little or no glass around the doorway, there may be a considerable difference in the illumination between outside and inside, particularly when the street is brightly lit by sunlight. This will make the inside look black to someone approaching the door from the outside, and he will be unable to see to the other side of the door</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict must enable people to see to the other side of the door. Clear glass doors are essential (see Building research station digest 44 second series, p.1).</p>
  <p>There must not be a great difference in the illumination on both sides of the doors. If there is glazing all round the doors, sufficient light will penetrate. Any walls near to the doors should be light in colour, to reflect as much light as possible. Gloag and Keyte discuss the problem of entering an office building in daytime, and recommend that the entrance lobby be light in colour, and suggest generous fenestration is justified (see H. L. Gloag and M. J. Keyte, Rational aspects of colouring in building interiors 2, Architect s journal, 21st March, 1957, p.447).</p>
  <p>Once it is possible for people to gee anyone approaching the other side of the door, a further feature is necessary. The two people must be able to go through different doors. The doors must therefore be arranged in pairs.</p>

  <p>The following tendencies may conflicts:</p>
  <p>a. When the pavement is busy, people will tend to use every inch of it.</p>
  <p>b. People tend to push the door open, on leaving.</p>
  <p>c. People try to avoid walking into things.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>If the entrance door swings open onto the pavement, people will either not be able to use the full width of it, or else they will collide with the door. Any door parallel to the pavement and flush with the face of the building, will cause a conflict, because when pushed open it will project onto the pavement.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflicts:</p>
  <p>To prevent a conflict the doors can be set back or recessed from the pavement, or turned away from being parallel to the pavement, so that the doors open sideways into some sort of recess.</p>

  </table>People walking towards each other on the pavement, move slightly to one side, so that they pass without touching and without slowing down. However, when they approach round a corner, they may not see each other in time, and may bump into each other. This may happen where an office entrance opens directly onto the pavement. People going out may collide with people about to go in or who are passing by on the pavement.
  <p>The following tendencies may conflict:</p>
  <p>a. People are trying to see anyone approaching them, some distance ahead, so that they can avoid bumping into them without slowing down.</p>
  <p>b. People tend to take the shortest path through the entrance; they tend to keep close to the corners.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>The conflict will occur if the wall at the corner of the entrance is solid and turns the corner at right angles. If there is a high projection at the corner, which people have to walk round, such as a sculpture or wall, the conflict will still occur.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>Several arrangements will prevent the conflict. If the corner is not made sharp but is rounded into a gradual curve, then people going round the corner can see far enough ahead. Another way to prevent the conflict, is to place a low obstruction, such as a low wall or flower tub at the corner, so that people have to walk round the obstruction and are then able to see people approaching them over the top of it. The corner, itself, can be cut back above about 3ft, so that people can again see over the top. If there is a projecting screen placed at the corner, glazed above 3ft people will have to walk round the screen, but they will be able to see through it.</p>
  <p>The essential property of all these arrangements is that: if the path into the entrance is defined as 1ft clear of all obstructions, chords drawn between any two points about 15ft apart on this path, will not be obstructed above about 3ft, by any opaque object.</p>

  <p>The following tendencies conflict:</p>
  <p>a. Tendency for wheelchair users to seek employment in offices.</p>
  <p>Many societies have been set up to promote the employment of disabled people.</p>
  <p>b. People entering buildings in wheelchairs, try to enter through the same entrance as people who walk.</p>
  <p>This tendency seems to be true of those wheelchair users who are independent enough to seek normal employment. Such people try to live as normal a life as possible. (Elimination of Architectural barriers to the physically disabled, Prof. T. J. Nugent of Illinois University, unpublished lecture given at RIBA, 9th October, 1962.)</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>Any abrupt change of level at the entrance, such as a step; a steep ramp at the entrance; doors with narrow leaves; or entrances with only revolving doors as a means of access; all these arrangements will cause the conflict.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>A smooth level access from the pavement into the entrance lobby. Sloped access which has a gradient of no more than 1:10. It is also necessary that the leaves of doors must be at least 2ft-7ins wide, so that a wheelchair can pass through a doorway with only one door being opened.</p>
  <p>Note: The maximum slope and minimum width for the path, are based on Designing for the disabled, Selwyn Goldsmith, RIBA 1964, in particular p.41.</p>

  </table>People entering and leaving the building, will try to take the shortest path through the entrance. If there is an invisible obstruction such as a large clear glass screen, people may walk into it. Two cases of people repeatedly walking into glass in entrances, and breaking it, have been reported in the Architects Journal (Working details revisited, Michael Devereau, architect's journal, 25th August, 1965).
  <p>Where clear floor-to-ceiling glass is used in the entrance, the following tendencies may conflict:</p>
  <p>a. People try to take the shortest path through the entrance.</p>
  <p>b. People try to avoid walking into things.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>Two different arrangements cause the conflicts reported by Devereau. In one case a large sheet of glass appears to have been mistaken for an opening (op. cit. p.429). In the other case two panels at both ends of a row of doors the same size as the doors and glazed in a similar manner, have been mistaken for doors (op. cit. p.432).</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>Several arrangements prevent conflict: bold markings placed on the glass just below eye level; the use of patterned glass; a substantial solid panel between the glass and floor; guard rails in front of the glass; or objects such as flower boxes placed in front of the glass (see Building research station, digest 44 second series, p.2 fig. 4).</p>
  <p>All these arrangements have the following in common: floor-to-ceiling glass has substantial markings or objects fixed to or in front of it. These objects are below eye level, and they are positioned along the full length of the glass.</p>

  </table>The entrance is the first part of the building seen by visitor, so the owners of the building will try to keep it looking clean. However, bad weather makes this difficult, because people carry in wet and dirt from the street.
  <p>In wet weather, the following tendencies conflict:</p>
  <p>a. Most people walk straight into an office entrance, without wiping their feet.</p>
  <p>b. Building owners try to reduce the amount of cleaning necessary in the entrance.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>The conflict will occur in any entrance which does not have some form of absorbant mat. Most entrances do have some sort of mat, but they are usually no more than 2, 3 or 4ft wide. In fact many people walking across mats of this size will only put one foot on the mat, the other foot will oversail to the other side.</p>
  <p>Note: The small mat only causes a conflict where the doors are of the conventional type, because people walk through these doors at a moderate walking pace. If the mat is incorporated in a revolving door, it might be sufficient to avoid a conflict, because people tend to shuffle through a revolving door.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>They are as follows: an absorbant mat under cover outside the doors, and stretching the full width of the doorway; draught lobbies with an absorbant mat covering the entire floor; a mat inside the entrance covering the full width of the doorway.</p>
  <p>Clearly some form of absorbant mat is required, which is under cover and between the pavement and the entrance lobby, and which intercepts every possible entry path. However, it is not so clear how wide the mat should be. If the mat is 5ft wide, people will have to put both feet onto it as they walk across. If the mat is 10ft wide they will have to put both feet onto it twice. How many times must each foot step onto the mat, to remove surplus wet and dirt? Much depends on how absorbant the mat is. The 10ft width that is specified in the relation is no more than a guess, but it is based on the performance of mats in common use.</p>

  </table>People will assume that the floor of the entrance is level. They will, therefore, give their attention to other things opening doors, avoiding other people, walking round obstructions, hurrying to get into a lift, etc. - rather than looking at the floor in front of them. If the floor is not level they will trip up.
  <p>The following tendencies may conflict:</p>
  <p>a. People passing through the entrance tend to look ahead, choosing their path.</p>
  <p>b. People try to avoid tripping on raised edges; women try to avoid catching their heels in holes or gaps in the floor.</p>
  <p>Chain link mats in entrance lobbies have been reported to have been replaced by coir mats, because women complained that their heels caught in the holes (see Working details revisited, Michael Devereau, architect's journal, 25th August, 1965, pp. 429- 431).</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>They are as follows: an isolated stepped change of level; weather strips projecting above the surrounding floor level of the entrance threshold; door mats standing proud of the surrounding surfaces or sunk well below; any floor finishes which have holes or gaps.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>If there are no isolated changes of level, and no holes or ridges in the floor, and if all mats and weather strips are flush with surrounding floor surfaces, the conflict will not occur. The essential property of all these arrangements is smooth flatness.</p>

  </table>The receptionist will try to sit facing the door. Perhaps she wants to see who is coming in, to have advance warning of an enquiry, or she may want to discourage people coming in without legitimate business in the building. Whatever her reason, it is not possible to sit facing every point of entry in many office entrances.
  <p>Where a receptionist is in an entrance lobby, the following tendencies many conflict:</p>
  <p>a. The receptionist will try to sit facing all points of entry into the lobby.</p>
  <p>b. People entering the building, tend to use the door on the shortest path into the entrance.</p>
  <p>(See Tyros Porter, op. cit., in particular studies of Berkeley post office steps and Berkeley library entry. )</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>They are as follows: more than one group of doors on opposite sides of the entrance lobby; and entrance door behind or to the side of the reception desk; any column, wall or screen obstructing the receptionist's view of the doors.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>For the receptionist to face all doors, the doors mast be grouped together, in front of the reception desk. And to ensure that she can see the doors, there must be no obstruction between her desk and the entrance doors into the lobby.</p>

  <p>The following tendencies may conflict:</p>
  <p>a. On entering the entrance lobby, visitors search for the reception point or the lift.</p>
  <p>b. The eyes take a few moments to adapt to sharp changes in illumination.</p>
  <p>In particular when entering from a brightly lit street, into a dimly lit entrance lobby.</p>
  <p>c. People tend to move towards brighter objects. (See Tyros Porter, op. cit., study of Hearst Memorial room in the De Young Museum.)</p>
  <p>d. People try to move directly, by the shortest path and without hesitation, to their first objective - the reception desk or the lifts.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>If there is an obstruction, such as a column or wall, between the doors into the lobby and the reception point or lifts, then the visitor cannot see his next objective on entering the lobby, and cannot therefore move directly towards it. Similarly, he cannot see the lifts or reception desk if they are away to one side of the entrance lobby, and not facing the visitor as he goes in through the door.</p>
  <p>The conflict is made more complex when the street is sunlit. If the lobby is generally dimly lit, the visitor may not be able to see the lifts and reception immediately on entering. If there is some bright object or area facing him as he goes in, the visitor may begin to walk towards it, before discovering he is going in the wrong direction.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>To prevent the conflict, the reception desk and lifts must be clearly visible to a visitor as he pushes the door open into the lobby. The reception desk and lifts must, therefore, be directly in front of the entrance doors, with no obstructions between these objectives and the doors. To ensure that the lift doors and the reception desk are quickly seen, they should be brightly lit.</p>

  <p>The following tendencies may conflict:</p>
  <p>a. Visitors try to move directly, without hesitation, from the entrance doors to the reception desk.</p>
  <p>b. Visitors tend to seek time and space in which to reorient their thoughts, between leaving the busy pavement, and arriving at the reception desk.</p>
  <p>Porter made observations of an entrance to a department store in Berkeley. A number of display cases separate the store front from the street, forming an arcade between street and store. He found that most people entering the store chose a path through the arcade rather than the direct path between the pavement and door to the store. He suggests that people will choose to use a transition space to reorient themselves, on entering a space which is radically different from the one they have just left.<br>
  (See Tyrus Porter, op. cit. study of Rink's Arcade, Berkeley.)</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>An entrance which has the receptionist just inside the door, particularly if there is no draught lobby, will cause this conflict.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>If the receptionist is placed well away from the entrance doors, or if there are one or more lobbies between the street and reception, the conflict does not occur. The essential property of these arrangements is that the visitor must cross a quiet space, after leaving the street, before arriving at the reception point. 40 ft seems to be about the minimum distance he should have to walk.</p>

If the reception point is in an isolated position, the receptionist can be lonely. It has been observed that receptionists working in positions where people stop and chat, appear relatively content, but those in isolated positions are the ones who find the most to complain about.
  <p>Where the receptionist is the only person working in the entrance lobby, the following tendencies may conflict:</p>
  <p>a. The management tries to ensure that the receptionist is always available to help visitors.</p>
  <p>b. The receptionist will try to talk to other office staff in the building.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>If the reception desk is tucked away in some corner of the entrance lobby, where no one goes, except to see the receptionist, the receptionist will not be able to stay at her desk and at the same time talk to other staff. If she is near the main path of movement into the entrance, again, only visitors will have any reason to stop and talk. If the reception point is right in front of the lifts, just where people stop and wait for a lift, then people will talk to her. The trouble here is that when a visitor arrives, the receptionist may prefer to finish a conversation before attending to the visitor.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>If the receptionist was a little way away from the lifts, so that people would wait near to, but not around the reception desk, there would be no conflict. People would be near enough to pass the time of day, but would not actually obstruct the reception desk.</p>
  <p>The essential property of this arrangement is that the receptionist is about 15ft away from people waiting for a lift. Near enough to speak, but not near enough to obstruct the desk. The difficulty with this relation is not so much what distance is necessary between reception and the point where people wait for a lift, as where this point is. A very tentative definition would be a point in front of the lifts, which is roughly equidistant from the two lifts that are furthest apart, and about 6ft away from the nearest lift.</p>

  <p>b. Visitors try to get near to the receptionist, taking the easiest path.</p>
  <p>c. The receptionist will try to move out from behind her desk, when helping some visitors, without losing visual contact with them.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>A narrow fronted desk, which allows visitors to move round to the side, easily; a desk placed away from a wall or screen, so that visitors can approach the receptionist from behind or from the side; a glass screen on top of the reception desk, with an open access at the side, so that people tend to go round to the side to avoid speaking through a glass screen; an obstruction such as a wall or column between the reception desk and way out from behind the desk, so that the receptionist has to disappear behind it when she walks round to the front.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>If the reception desk faces the entrance doors, visitors will tend to approach the front of the reception desk. To prevent visitors tending to move round to the side of the desk, the receptionist should have some barrier behind and to the side of her.

  <p>a. The receptionist will try to make visitors wait a little way away from her desk.</p>
  <p>b. Visitors who have to wait, try to wait near to and in sight of the receptionist.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>

Similarly, visitors will not use seats which face away from the receptionist. If seats are placed more than about 20ft from the reception desk, again, they will not be used. In each case, visitors will tend to stand close to the reception desk, rather than sit down.</p>

  <p>Arrangements which cause conflict:</p>
  <p>If the seats do not face any part of the entrance lobby, or if there is an opaque screen or wall between the seats and the lobby, then a visitor cannot sit and watch a centre of interest. If the seats are unscreened, people in the entrance lobby can easily see any visitor who is waiting. This arrangement would be worse if the waiting area was brightly lit, so that it became a focal point.</p>
  <p>Arrangements which prevent conflict:</p>
  <p>The seats must, of course, face some centre of activity, either the lifts or the entrance doors. If the seats are behind a column or some plants or a display stand, then the visitor will be partly obscured from the rest of the lobby. The objects form a partial barrier between the waiting area and the lobby. The visitor can see the lobby but people in the lobby will hardly notice the visitor.</p>
