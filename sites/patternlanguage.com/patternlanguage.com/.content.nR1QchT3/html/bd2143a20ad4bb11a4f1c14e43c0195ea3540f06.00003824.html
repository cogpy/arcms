                <blockquote>
                  <font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">A sequence is an algorithm or recipe for describing which steps and decisions need to be taken and in what order for successful building. A sequence can be developed for anything, how to lay out an office, how to build a cottage, a parking lot, a campus, a neighborhood.</font></font>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">The demo shows a sequence for entrance transition, and how to use the sequence.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">Designing and building with sequences is very different from mainstream practice of architecture and of CAD-based design and management tools. Standard design and CAD methods force decisions at the wrong stage; a standard blueprint is a multitude of guesses about what might be right; a stand contract makes the guesses binding or, at least, costly to unbind. Feedback and step by step adaptation are precluded. To use a simple metaphor, a standard plan is like putting down 50 pennies and trying to flip them on to “heads” at the same time (slim odds). Sequences are about flipping one penny at a time, getting it right, and then flipping the second one. The chances for success are much higher, it doesn’t take more time or cost more money, but it does require working differently. It also means paying attention to subtle and critical aspects of space, light, volume in ways that are different and make all the difference.</font></font></p>
                  <p><font color="yellow"><font color="#FFCC66" face="Times New Roman">Sequences are about unfolding. To take a biological example, a human embryo will develop through the repetition of simple steps, but a mishap in the sequence will mean malformation. During normal growth what happens at any given stage is a preserving and enhancement of the previous stage. Although all embryos unfold in a similar way, they all come out slightly different: we all have our own special faces and fingerprints. Sequences, with appropriate support from computers, and building processes can allow for each building to exactly fit needs and do so at a very good cost. They allow a layperson and a builder to understand each other about what is exactly wanted and needed. More profoundly, they allow for better buildings.</font></font></p>
