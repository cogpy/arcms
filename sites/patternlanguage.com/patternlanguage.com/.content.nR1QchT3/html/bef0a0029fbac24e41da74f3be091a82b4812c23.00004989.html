        <h4><b>Introduction</b></h4>
        <p>Two examples of Anatolian art, from the Seljuk period dating roughly from the 13th century, have a peculiarly dramatic and powerful intensity in their use of space. One is a tiled wall in the Cinili Kiosk, Istanbul;<br>
        <img src="cinili-2.jpg" width="500"><br>
        <i>The exterior of the building</i><br>
        <img src="cinili-1.jpg" width="500"><br>
        <i>The innermost tiled room</i></p>
        <p>the other, a great off-white and red carpet of immense size, now hanging in the Turk ve Islam Museum, Istanbul, and originating in Beyshehir in central Anatolia.<br>
        <img src="seljuk-1.jpg" width="500"><br>
        <i>The great carpet under discussion is the leftmost of these two carpets hanging in the museum</i><br></p>
        <p>Both works contain polygons, apparently swimming in a sea of space, but the space is carefully sized and controlled in its dimension, that the hexagons (Kiosk) and octagons (carpet) seem animated by tension and aliveness.</p>
        <p>Anyone who has seen these two objects will testify to their extraordinary power. The purpose of this article, is to inquire about the <i>source</i> of this special power and to draw inferences about the nature of living structure.</p>

        <h4><b>Variation in the carpet design</b></h4>
        <p>When one examines the carpet, one cannot help noticing the extraordinary variuation which occurs. The pattern seems, at first, regular. It is, after all, simply a repeating red octagon, on an off-white field. But the red octagons vary in size, in the angle of the diagonal edges, in the squashedness, in their size, and in their spacing. Yet the spacing, appears regular, more or less, anyway.</p>
        <p>What is the origin of the irregularity? Is merely an artefact of inaccurate production, or is it something more interesting?<br>
        <img src="seljuk-2.jpg" width="500"><br>
        <i>At htis scale we begin to notice variation, but it is not altogether pronounced</i></p>
        <p><img src="seljuk-3.jpg" width="500"></p>
        <p><img src="seljuk-4.jpg" width="500"><br>
        <i>When we look at the octagons in detail, we first see the truly extraordinary level of variation from octagon to octagon. This photograph is not distorted by perspective, or by shrinking of the carpet: this is how the octagons were DRAWN originally, and how they appear, without distortion.</i><br></p>
        <p>There are of course various possible explanations for the enormous variation. The carpet has shrunk or been stretched, during its 700 years of life. The weaver did not know how to make the octagons more accurate, because her available methods were "primitive." The distortions are simply mistakes. It was intended to be regular, but came out irregular because the methods were not accurate enough to make them regular.</p>
        <p>After careful examination of the carpet I have become quite certain that these explanations are wrong. The weaver could easily have made the octagons equal, if she, or he, had so desired. The carpet has not stretched or shrunk -- until it was brought to the museum, it was after all lying in the same position on the floor of the mosque for which it was made for all those hundreds of years. What could have shrunk it or distorted it.</p>
        <p>No, I have no doubt whatever, that the variation we see was itnroduced for one reason or another, by the weaver.</p>

        <h4><b>One possible reason for the variation</b></h4>
        <p>There is one kind of reason for variation that one often sees mentioned in amateur carpet-lovers books. "The variations was introduced because of the evil eye, or to make the carpet more interesting" -- just because too much regularity would have been less interesting.</p>
        <p>This explanation, too, I find to be nonsensical.</p>
        <p>The tilework in the Cinili Kiosk, shown above, was made at roughly the same date, with a very similar kind of design. It is perfectly regular. Variation could have been introduced. But it was not.</p>
        <p>What is perhaps more significant and telling, is the result of my own observation. After examining the stupifying artistic effect of this carpet, and the care with which it was made, I am quite certain that any explanation along these amateurish lines is just too silly to be believed.</p>
