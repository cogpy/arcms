In these postmodern times of distortional postructural theories and cynical deconstructivist designs, Alexander's work is a beacon illuminating a way to make the world more robust, beautiful, and kind. Such a world is utopian, of course, and never really gained in real life. Yet books like The Phenomenon of Life and real-world projects like his Mexicali experiment and Japanese Eishin School demonstrate at least a partial actualization of his extraordinary vision. In turn, this vision and work may well inspire a new generation of practitioners and thinkers, and so a virtuous circle may proceed. ...</span></td>

        <span class="h3class">Dear Chris, I have been keeping my eyes open for this book ever since I learned you were writing it back when I was your student in the early '80's. The class that I took from you in which you taught some of your theories about the nature of order was the most interesting and most memorable in my entire educational experience. It was the only class that provided me objective criteria with which to observe, perceive, and analyze architecture or, for that matter, many other types of man-made artifacts that, 20 years later, I still consciously remember, think about, and use today. Your ideas were a revelation to me, profound and fundamental.</span>
        <p><span class="h3class">One of the most miserable moments in my life was the theft of a car I owned. Not because the car meant anything to me but because all my notes and projects from your class were in the car. I was left with nothing but memories about the ideas to which you introduced me in that class.</span></p>
        <p><span class="h3class">... now finally the book I have waited for for almost 20 years is going to be published. I have ordered all of them and can hardly wait until I receive them.</span></p>

        <span class="h3class">Alexander's genetic scripts are likely to become as ordinary as reading and writing; and will play a role so fundamental in the future, that their widespread use cannot even be imagined today. Twenty years ago, the idea of spread sheets had barely been invented. Today, it is hardly possible to imagine modern accounting, business planning, or business practice without spread sheets. Yet twenty years ago, almost no one except the inventors and developers, knew that a simple device could put complex arithmetic manipulation of charts, cash flows, payroll, under the user's control on a home computer.</span>
        <p><span class="h3class">The scripts which Alexander has invented have a similar, perhaps greater potential, in the field of building. Today it is assumed that buildings can only be designed by specialists, and as a result we live in a world where they rarely, if ever, meet the needs of their inhabitants. No one knows that a device exists, in principle, with which all users and architects and builders they themselves could lay out buildings, to their own satisfaction, with a device no more complicated than an Excel spread sheet.</span></p>
        <p><span class="h3class">I believe that the design of buildings -- more beautiful buildings, better designed, more organic, and more appropriately fitted to need and terrain, each unique to its special place -- can one day be done by everyone in the world, with the help of Alexander's genetic scripts. This will change the world as effectively as the advent of printing changed the world. The physical environment, which we consider today, an almost hopeless task can, and will, under this advent of this step forward in technology, become something which everybody in the world takes part in, and with means as simple as the scripts which they can find and download from their computer.</span></p>

        <p>... Personally I have for a long time been interested in the reevaluation of medieval architecture and urbanism within the classical tradition. Surprisingly I find this interest supported by thinking referring to New Sciences. I am reading "The Nature of Order" by Christopher Alexander which seems also to offer very sharp perspectives bridging over some prejudiced antagonism between classicism and non-classical architectural cultures. Remembering the depreciative comments on Byzantine Architecture which have been made recently on this list (the TradArch listserver) referring to arguments of clumsy detailing and a lack of artistical refinement I was very pleased to find Alexander widening his range of value criterias to a more comprehensive notion of wholesomeness and aliveness, meaning a complexity and subtle interaction of patterns which support beauty in an objective and universal manner.</p>
