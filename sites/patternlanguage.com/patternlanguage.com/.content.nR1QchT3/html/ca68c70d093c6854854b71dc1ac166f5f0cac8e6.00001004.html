  <h1>CHAPTER 2<br>
  USE OF THE ORDINANCE</h1>
  <h2 class="lines">2.1<br>
  INTRODUCTION</h2>
  <p>We have seen how the wholeness of the city requires that certain important factors be taken into account in a balanced fashion. In particular it requires that every project which is built is conceived in such a way that it explicitly helps play its role fn establishing and improving the coherence of the neighborhood.</p>
  <p>In detail, this requires that the following important ten steps be taken by every applicant, in the course of establishing a project.</p>
  <p>1. The applicant must make a conscious attempt to understand the context of the surroundings, and then to make sure that his project establishes a useful and harmonious relationship with this context. (1.1)</p>
  <p>2. The applicant must find out what position is necessary for the main garden, so that it contributes, in a beautiful and useful way, to the overall continuum of open space in the neighborhood. (1.2)</p>
  <p>3. The applicant must find out which set of numerical parameters he can and wishes to use, in regard to total density of built space, and number of parking spaces. (1.3)</p>
  <p>4. The applicant must establish the position of parking, in n way which is most discrete, and does least harm to the neighborhood (2.1)</p>
  <p>5. The applicant must shape the gardens, parking and open space in relation to adjacent gardens (2.2)</p>
  <p>6. The applicant must now place the volume of the buildings in his proposed project, in a way which is consistent with the previous important decisions about open space and parking (2.3)</p>
  <p>7. The applicant must now arrange for details of driveway and parking, in a fashion which is consistent with the position of building volumes, choosing parking parameters that will maintain the necessary number of spaces, necessary visual modesty, and maintain the modest and small character of driveways and curb cuts (3.1)</p>
  <p>8. The applicant must now try to create useful and pleasant apartments, with their own individuality, making sure that apartments have good daylight, and the possibility of a personal character (3.2).</p>
  <p>9. The applicant must now place apartment enrtrances in such a way as to give pleasant and safe passage from parking, easily recognised individual apartments, with access, wherever possible, to private outdoor space. (3.3)</p>
  <p>10. The applicant must take steps to choose materials, roofs, walls and windows, to guarantee a reasonable and pleasant harmony to the neighborhood (4.1)</p>
  <p>11. Finally the applicant must choose outdoor elements, including trees, lawns, plants, seats, walls, gates and benches, in such a way as to guarantee a useful and pleasant character for all outdoor space. (4.2)</p>
  <p>These steps follow, necessarily, from the general philosophy expressed in chapter 1. The global requirements of the neighborhoods, cannot be met unless each project, individually, is made responsible for these eleven steps which will make sure that the individual project, does the maximum psosible, to help the environment of the neighborhood, without infringing on the individual rights or desires of the project itself.</p>
  <p>In the process of this ordinance, each applicant must fill out a series of application forms which essentially guarantee adherence to these general principles, and which compel the applicant, step by step, to consider these matters in an organised and useful way.</p>
  <p>We believe that these steps will not seem coercive to the applicant, since any applicant surely has, as a fundamental purpose, his ability to make a maximum contribution to the overall well-being of the neighborhood. The format of the application process, merely makes it natural and sensible for each applicant to makes these contributions to the neighborhood's well-being, in a clear and simple fashion.</p></a> <a name="2_2" id="2_2">
  <h2 class="lines">2.2<br>
  APPLICATION FORMS</h2>
  <p>This section contains the application forms which are to be filled out by any prospective applicant for a building permit.</p>
  <p>There are four parts to the application form. These four parts should be filled out sequentially, and then checked for compliance at each stage by a member of the planning department. The procedure for checking compliance appears explicitly on the forms. An experienced applicant may choose to submit all four parts concurrently.</p>
  <p>The numbering system of the parts in the application forms is keyed, both to the steps in the layout process which follows this section (section 2.3) and to the relevant sections of the ordinance itself (sections 3.2 and 3.3).</p>

  LAYOUT PROCESS</h2>
  <p>The layout process defined in this section is not mandatory. It is intended as a guide for the applicant, to make it possible for him to use the application forms as effectively as possible.</p>
  <p>The backbone of the layout process lies in its structure and sequence. Like the application forms it has four main parts, and within these four parts there are eleven detailed steps.</p>
  <p class="revind"></p></a><a href="#2_3p1">1. RELATIONSHIP TO NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT</a><br>
  1.1 Map the context and surroundings.<br>
  1.2 Decide basic arrangement and position of main garden to enhance surrounding projects and the neighborhood.<br>
  1.3 Calculate numerical parameters.
  <p class="revind"><a href="#2_3p2">2. OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF PROJECT.</a><br>
  2.1 Provide driveway and locate parking.<br>
  2.2 Shape gardens precisely in relationship with adjacent gardens.<br>
  2.3 Place building volumes.</p>
  <p class="revind"><a href="#2_3p3">3. DETAILED ORGANIZATION OF PROJECT</a><br>
  3.1 Lay out details of parking.<br>
  3.2 Division into apartments.<br>
  3.3 Locate and shape apartment entrances.</p>
  <p class="revind"><a href="#2_3p4">4. CHARACTER OF PROJECT</a><br>
  4.1 Choose building details and materials.<br>
  4.2 Design details of gardens.</p>
  <p>These steps are designed to be simple, smooth, and coherent in their sequence, so that the applicant can fill out the application forms, with a minimum of fuss, and also with a minimum of interpretation. An applicant who fills out the necessary steps, in the required order, will be able to establish his conformity with the legal requirements of the zoning ordinance in a minimum of time, and with a minimum of effort. The process is also designed to reduce to a minimum the amount of interpretation and discretion required from city staff.</p>
  <p>The process is also designed to facilitate the actual design and planning of new development projects. Since the sequence of steps in the application process has been chosen with great care, so that a potential developer who merely wishes to check the possibility of a project on a new site, can pencil out a feasible project within a very short time, merely by following the steps in the order given. This will then enable him to create a project which meets all legal requirements, and to examine the possible results of a conforming project, quickly and economically.</p>
  <p>We believe this new aspect of the zoning ordinance will greatly facilitate the development process, and that it will encourage new projects of high quality.</p>
  <p>At the end of this chapter, there are four worked examples, showing projects which have been generated by this layout process. <a name="2_3p1" id="2_3p1">
  <h4 class="lines" align="center">PART 1<br>
  RELATIONSHIP TO NEIGHBORHOOD CONTEXT</h4>
  <h4>STEP 1.1 MAP THE CONTEXT AND SURROUNDINGS.</h4>
  <p>To begin the layout process, and to make sure that your project does something useful for the neighborhood, it is necessary to start by understanding, deeply, the essential structure of what is there, both on your lot, and in the immediate vicinity.</p>
  <p>Draw a map at a scale of 1 inch equals 50 feet. The map must show your lot, two lots on either side, the back 50' of the lots behind these five lots, and the front 100' of the five lots across the street.</p>
  <p>Show dimensions.</p>
  <p>On this drawing survey and identify the following structures:</p>
  <p>1. Lot boundaries.</p>
  <p>2. Footprints of all buildings on surrounding lots. Each building or part of a building muse be shown with its approximate height in feet.</p>
  <p>3. All gardens on surrounding lots. Examine how big they are, where they are located, what their shapes are. In particular, you must identify adjacent gardens which are worth while for you to make a connection to them, or worth while sitting and looking in their direction and enjoying them.</p>
  <p>4. Beautiful open space in the street, which helps to create the atmosphere of the neighborhood.</p>
  <p>5. Parking structures on surrounding lots.</p>
  <p>6. Big trees on your site or on the street, and on adjacent lots.</p>
  <p>7. Existing driveways and back-alleys on nearby lots, with special reference to any possible pattern of access in which these existing driveways and alleys might serve the back of your lot.</p>
  <p>8. Setback dimensions on adjacent lots.</p>
  <p>9. Any windows on next door buildings facing your lot, which serve living areas, and must have good light preserved.</p>
  <p>10. Groups of doors or other entrances on next door lots, which create a pattern of movement and pleasantness that must be preserved, and which may form the basis of s new space or focus in your project.</p>
  <p>11. Walkways and entrance paths on surrounding lots.</p>
  <h4>STEP 1.2. DECIDE BASIC ARRANGEMENT AND POSITION OF MAIN GARDEN TO ENHANCE SURROUNDING PROJECTS AND THE NEIGHBORHOOD.</h4>
  <p>The character of the neighborhood which is described on Chapter 1 of the Zoning Ordinance, page, can <em>only</em> be obtained when each individual project is made to work together and connect with its adjacent lots. The beauty of character which we hope for, cannot arise merely as a result of what is done on individual parcels, but <em>only</em> as a result of coherent relationship and connection between parcels with regard to gardens, courtyards, parking, buildings, setbacks, light and air, and driveways.</p>
  <p>This principle is fundamental to the nature of the new zoning ordinance. It seeks to promote a type of connection between adjacent developments so as to create a larger whole for the benefit of the entire neighborhood. This is especially fundamental, since the great majority of new construction in Pasadena, is single lot development. At present, 90% of all developments occur on single lots. Even with incentives to encourage development of double parcels, we believe that single lot development will always represent 80% of new projects.</p>
  <p>In any case it is also desirable, that development be kept small in scale, since this will continue to maintain the intimate character of Pasadena which has existed in the past. Large lot development introduces an undesirable and commercial crudeness of grain. It is desirable that the city should be able to build up the beautiful and coherent character described in part one, in an <em>intimate fashion</em>. This can only be done when adjacent lots connect to each other and are made to work in relationship to each other.</p>
  <p>The success of this ordinance therefore requires an entirely new frame of mind. When approaching a development, it is necessary for the developer to ask himself consciously, how what <em>he</em> does, on <em>his</em> lot, will connect and work together with adjacent developments, to produce a harmonious whole in the neighborhood.</p>
  <p class="center">-o0o-</p>
  <p>In particular the following types of connection between adjacent lots are all critical:</p>
  <p>1. Connection between position of gardens or open spaces, either on the interior or front of the lot, to form larger gardens and open spaces.</p>
  <p>2. Working together between building volume positions, to maintain the coherency of open space and light access, and to permit growth of relatively long stretches of building volume parallel to the street.</p>
  <p>3. Sharing between driveways and back alleys, with easements, to reduce the number of driveways.</p>
  <p>4. Connection between parking lot positions, to improve accessibility from driveways and alleys.</p>
  <p class="center">-o0o-</p>
  <p>Now, examine the context map prepared on the previous step regarding the following matters:</p>
  <p>1. Identify next door gardens facing towards your lot, with which the proposed garden in your lot can connect in order to create a larger garden; or any beautiful open space along the street on the adjacent lots, front lawns or deep front gardens, which is worthwhile preserving and extending by your acts.</p>
  <p>2. Examine carefully the position and configuration of building volumes on adjacent lots and consider the possibility of placing your volumes in a way that creates continuity of building volumes along the street.</p>
  <p>3. The possibility to obtain easement for the use of existing driveway on adjacent lot.</p>
  <p>4. Examine the configuration of existing parking on adjacent lots, whether or not they interfere with the use of existing driveway on adjacent lot.</p>
  <p class="center">-o0o-</p>
  <p>Finally, before beginning the detailed design and layout of your project, it is necessary to get a single basic vision of the project.</p>
  <p>This vision hinges on <em>the position and nature of the main garden</em>, and the way this main garden is supported and created by the building volume. You must decide where the main garden is, and in what fashion the building volume will surround this main garden, and complement it.</p>
  <p>It is fundamental to the process being used in this ordinance, that your solution to this problem emanates from the pattern of existing space and buildings in the neighborhood <em>and that it does the maximum possible to help the neighborhood</em>.</p>
  <p>You must be able to argue that the position of the main garden you have chosen, and the overall arrangement of space does the maximum possible for the lot, for the street, and for the neighborhood.</p>
  <p><em>Choose a single position of the main garden which does the most possible to connect with existing spaces on next-door lots, and which also does the most possible to provides balanced variety of space in the neighborhood</em>.</p>
  <p class="center">-o0o-</p>
  <p>More precisely:</p>
  <p>The main garden must be a single rectangle, and must be placed in such a way as to connect with nearby gardens and street space, respect adjacent buildings and the qualities of the your lot.</p>
  <p>There are numerous ways according to which the main garden can do this. For example:</p>
  <p>a. If there is an existing large interior garden on the adjacent lot, the proposed main garden should be placed so that these two spaces work together to form one single internal garden.</p>
  <p>b. If there is beautiful front garden in the street, or the feeling of a broad lawn, with the frontage of the buildings at least 30' to 35' back from the sidewalk, the proposed main garden should connect with existing front garden on at least one side, so as to form a "long" garden along the street.</p>
  <p>c. If there is a need for a deep open apace on the street, part of proposed building frontage should be located at least 75' back from the sidewalk, so as to form a "deep" garden on the street. In this case, the front garden must be enclosed by existing buildings of adjacent lots on at least one aide.</p>
  <p>d. If there is a need for spacious internal courtyard on the block, proposed main garden should be an internal courtyard entirely contained within the lot. This is mainly possible on a lot wider than 80', and is difficult on a narrower lot.</p>
  <p>In addition: e. If there is a beautiful tree or stand of trees, the proposed main garden should be placed so that the trees form a focal point of the main garden.</p>
  <p>f. If there is an apartment building on an adjacent lot, with entrances facing the proposed building, the main garden should be placed so that those entrances are on the edge of a large shared space which includes the main garden.</p>
  <p>g. If there is a single family house next door, the main garden should be placed so that there is a large apace next to the house, for light and view.</p>
  <p class="center">-o0o-</p>
  <p>Of course, the way in which the main garden can best improve the positive qualities of the existing place depends on the specific site itself, and there may be some other important feature, not listed above, which could be helped by the placement of the main garden.</p>
  <p>Or, it may be that the site has more than one important, positive features--for example, a stand of trees on one side and the entrances to an adjacent apartment building on the other side. In such a case it is of course preferable that the main garden takes account of both. But, if this is not possible, then the main garden must respond to at least one of these positive features.</p>
  <h4>STEP 1.3 CALCULATE NUMERICAL PARAMETERS.</h4>
  <p>A. <em>Calculate maximum allowed square feet of construction</em>.</p>
  <p>This rule gives the maximum square feet of construction, allowed to be built in your lot.</p>
  <p>- Get clear about the density zone your lot belongs to.</p>
  <p>- Calculate the lot area.</p>
  <p>- Get context density, expressed in average number of units per lot, for all lots any part of which is within 150' on any point of the lot under development.</p>
  <p>- Define value of factor (C), as specified on the relevant density chart, Chapter 3, page...</p>
  <p>- Choose type of parking you plan to provide.</p>
  <p>- Calculate maximum allowed square feet of construction, as specified on the density charts, pages .... of Chapter 3.</p>
  <p>B. <em>Calculate required open space</em>.</p>
  <p>Now, figure out the total area that your lot must provide for the formation of all gardens and/or courtyards.</p>
  <p>First, calculate the required amount of total open space on the basis of the open space charts, pages .... of Chapter 3.</p>
  <p>Then, using the same charts, calculate the part of the total required open space which must be used for the formation of the main garden.</p>
  <p>This main garden is to be aggregated in the form of a single rectangular entity of space, which is surrounded and bounded by buildings, hedges or low walls. The remainder of the required open space will be used for the formation of secondary gardens.</p>
  <p>C. <em>Calculate number of apartment units</em>.</p>
  <p>Calculate number of units, N.</p>
  <p>Choose average apartment size between 700 sf and 1300 sf. Most typical average is 850 net, 1000 including stairs and hallways. Divide total built area by average size, to get number of units.</p>
  <p>D. <em>Calculate number of parking spaces and required parking area</em>.</p>
  <p>Minimum number of parking spaces is 1.5 times N.</p>
  <p>Total needed parking area will be approximately 450xN square feet. This number is not a requirement, but for convenience of calculation and layout.</p></a> <a name="2_3p2" id="2_3p2">

  OVERALL ORGANIZATION OF PROJECT.</h4>
  <h4>STEP 2.1 PROVIDE DRIVEWAY AND LOCATE PARKING.</h4>
  <p>A. <em>If possible, acquire easement on a driveway which is on adjacent lot</em>.</p>
  <p>If either of the two adjacent lots -- one on the right and one on the left -- adjacent to your property has already been developed to an apartment building, and if its driveway is capable of providing access to the rear of your lot by means of back alleys or connecting parking aisles, then you can share the use of this driveway, <em>if</em> the owner will agree to give an easement.</p>
  <p>The city makes the aquisition of an easement for the use of adjacent driveway possible by law. Investigate for attached conditions.</p>
  <p class="center">DIAGRAM</p>
  <p>If there is an existing house on an adjacent lot, you can use the driveway belonging to this house, <em>if</em> the owner will agree to give an easement. In this case your new development has to guarantee a spacious and pleasant green space that is adjacent to the house and is good for it; you must place your main garden adjacent to the existing house that provided you with the driveway easement.</p>
  <p>If there is no driveway available for shared use on the next door lot, you can investigate if there are any other possibilities: e.g. use of an existing back alley.</p>
  <p>In case you succeed to obtain an easement for the use of adjacent lot driveway or back alley, then you are entitled to a <em>density bonus</em>, as specified on the density charts, shown on pages of chapter 3.</p>
  <p>B. <em>If no easement is available, provide for a new driveway</em>.</p>
  <p>If you have chosen not to use an existing driveway, then you must provide an <em>eight to ten foot</em> driveway. No more than one driveway is allowed per lot.</p>
  <p>Locate the new driveway along the property line.</p>
  <p>You must bear in mind that in the future you might be asked to provide an easement on the driveway, which will allow tenants of other adjacent lots to use it.</p>
  <p>C. <em>Locate parking at the rear of the lot</em>.</p>
  <p>All surface parking, when aggregated, gust be located at the rear 40% of the lot. There are limited exceptions for locating parking in front of the 40% rear of the lot, as specified on Chapter 3, paragraph 2.1-C.</p>
  <p>All naturally ventilated parking must be located at the rear 502 of the lot. There are no exceptions.</p>
  <p>Mechanically ventilated parking must be located under building volumes. It will be allowed to extend under part of the rain garden if its area is larger than the footprint of the building. For details, see Chapter 3, paragraph 2.2-A.</p>
  <p>Details of parking layout are to be worked out later.</p>
  <h4>STEP 2.2 SHAPE GARDENS PRECISELY IN RELATIONSHIP WITH ADJACENT GARDENS.</h4>
  <p>A. <em>Now, shape the main garden precisely</em>.</p>
  <p>Adjust and refine the exact size, extent and shape of the main garden, taking into account the following:</p>
  <p>The main garden is to be aggregated in the form of a single rectangular entity of space, as specified by the guidelines and design standards, paragraphs 2.2-A of Chapter 3.</p>
  <p>The main garden must always be at ground level, above soil. There are limited exceptions, specified on paragraphs 2.2-A of Chapter 3. It is also important that the main garden, can itself be enlarged and extended by other future actions, by other developers on the neighboring lots on either side. To make this possible, the main garden must always open onto one side lotline, except in the case where the lot is more than 80' wide.</p>
  <p>B. <em>Place secondary gardens to encourage n connection between gardens</em>.</p>
  <p>In any case there must always be some garden touching one of the two side lotlines. Where this requirement is fulfilled by the main garden, there need not be any secondary garden. All required open space can be used for the formation of the main garden.</p>
  <p>On a lot 80' wide or less, where the main garden must touch one side yard, a secondary garden is not required.</p>
  <p>On a lot more than 80' wide, if the main garden does not touch at least one side lotline, a secondary garden must be created along one of the side lotlines.</p>
  <h4>STEP 2.3 PLACE BUILDING VOLUMES.</h4>
  <p>A. <em>Now, locate and shape your buildings according to the beauty of the garden and the character of the street</em>.</p>
  <p>Locate the building volumes in a way that provide substantial enclosure to the garden. At least 60% of the perimeter of the garden must be enclosed by buildings.</p>
  <p>At the same time, allow for connections end passages between gardens and open spaces.</p>
  <p>In addition, if appropriate to the configuration of the main garden, try to place one of your building volumes parallel to the direction of the street, to enclose the garden and contribute to the shaping of the street front.</p>
  <p>And bear in mind that the maximum width of building volumes is 35'.</p>
  <p>B. <em>While locating and shaping your building volumes allow your interior garden to be visible from the street</em>.</p>
  <p>Interior courtyards and gardens should be experienced from the street, and be visible from it, so that they contribute to the beauty and liveliness of the street.</p>
  <p>Some interior gardens will be wide open on the street and some will feel secluded, connected to the street through a passage. This type of variety is extremely desirable.</p>
  <p>At the time your new project is about to take place, the feeling of the whole street, from the point of view of visibility of gardens, has to be assessed.</p>
  <p>The new apartment should open or enclose its garden towards the street to a degree that contributes mainly to the liveliness and character of the street as a whole.</p>
  <p>C. <em>Pay attention to the front lot line</em>.</p>
  <p>Limited amount of single story building volumes are allowed to project forward existing front setbacks of adjacent buildings. These volumes or portions of volumes must be built in such a way that the front is 10' from the property line.</p>
  <p>If there is no other building on your side of the street, within 200' in either direction, that projects forward existing front setbacks, then you are strongly encouraged to place at least part of your building up to 10' from the front property line.</p>
  <p>D. <em>Check width of building volumes along the street</em>.</p>
  <p>E. <em>Permission to build closer than 4' to the rear and side lot line, while allowing for continuity of building volumes</em>.</p>
  <p>While placing your building volumes you should bear in mind that you are strongly encouraged to build closer than 4' to the side and rear lot lines, provided that you meet all requirements concerning light access to adjacent building volumes, as well as all other relevant design standards, specified in paragraphs 2.3-E and 2.3-F of chapter 3.</p>
  <p>There are two major reasons for allowing and encouraging this:</p>
  <p>i. No open space is waisted to leftover strips of unusable space.</p>
  <p>ii. The fact that a building volume can be on a side lot line allows for connection between adjacent building volumes in the sense that building volumes can extend most of the width of the lot, or they can touch each other. So, it is possible to introduce building volumes parallel to the street together with building volumes perpendicular to the street, thus enabling the formation and enclosure of gardens and courtyards.</p>
  <p>F. <em>Make sure that minimum separation requirements between proposed and adjacent building are met</em>.</p>
  <p>If you have decided to build a building volume closer than 4' from side or rear lot line, you should pay attention to existing major windows and entrances of adjacent buildings, and follow all relevant design standards, as specified on paragraphs 2.3f and 2.3-F of chapter 3.</p>
  <p>G. <em>Now, calculate again your total building volume, and finalize number of stories</em>.</p>
  <p>Throughout the building volume you have defined, the average building height will need to be two stories, to get the maximum allowable density. There will be occasional exceptions to one story, and some exceptions to three stories.</p>
  <p>In order to bring the building volume into line with the allowed development, the following adjustments must now be made.</p>
  <p>1. Any building volume projecting forward adjacent front setbacks must be one story.</p>
  <p>2. Array building volume within 50' of the street, for at least 50% of its length along the street, must be softened by one story porches, alcoves, room extensions or galleries.</p>
  <p>3. Any three story construction needed to complete the full allowable density, must be placed on the back 40% of the lot. Three story construction may be built over parking.</p></a> <a name="2_3p3" id="2_3p3">

  DETAILED ORGANIZATION OF PROJECT.</h4>
  <h4>STEP 3.1 LAY OUT DETAILS OF PARKING.</h4>
  <p>A. Locate parking spaces, following the design standards specified in paragraph 3.1-A of chapter 3.</p>
  <p>B. Design driveway, curbcut and/or ramp, following the design standards specified in paragraph 3.1-B of chapter 3.</p>
  <p>C. If driveway adjacent to garden, make it feel part of the garden.</p>
  <p>D. Shape parking space as positive and usable space.</p>
  <h4>STEP 3.2 DIVISION INTO APARTMENTS.</h4>
  <p>Within the overall building volume which has been established, the N apartments permitted by the ordinance, may now be identified.</p>
  <p>A. <em>Define the location of the apartments.</em></p>
  <p>Cut up the total volume, into apartments. There should be no attempt to make apartments of standard shape. Rather, each apartment should now take a shape which is appropriate to its unique position.</p>
  <p>Each living room or main room of apartment must have garden view.</p>
  <p>The apartments should be divided out, with the following rules in mind:</p>
  <p>i. At least one, and possibly two apartments should be entered directly from the street side, with entrances visible from the street.</p>
  <p>ii. In as many cases as possible, the apartments should have access from the main garden.</p>
  <p>B. <em>Provide for connection from the parking through the garden to the apartments.</em></p>
  <p>The pattern of circulation which is created should encourage very simple access from the parking lot, through the main garden, to the apartments.</p>
  <h4>STEP 3.3 LOCATE AND SHAPE APARTMENT ENTRANCES</h4>
  <p>A. <em>Provide apartment entrances from the i street.</em></p>
  <p>At least one, and possibly two apartments should be entered directly from the street side, with entrances visible from the street.</p>
  <p>B. <em>Locate entrances facing main garden.</em></p>
  <p>In as many cases as possible, the apartments should have access from the main garden.</p>
  <p>C. <em>Make apartment entrances identifiable.</em></p>
  <p>Some entrances to apartments should be embellished with porches, stoops, steps, or stairs. This should be done only for those cases where this element helps the overall structure.</p></a> <a name="2_3p4" id="2_3p4">
