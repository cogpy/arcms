            <br>
            Dear Mr. Alexander,<br>
            I have just heard the first of several reports on NPR's Weekend Edition regarding architecture. During the report they mentioned your website. I have just browsed through it and did read your open letter to visitors.<br>
            <br>
            I wanted you to know about the impact THE PATTERN LANGUAGE has had on me as a garden designer and writer. About 12 years ago I was working with a builder in Northampton, Massachusetts. He had designed a home high above The Connecticut River for a professor from Smith College and his wife using The Pattern Language as their guide to construction.<br>
            <br>
            When the home was completed, they contacted me to do the landscaping and I too used the book as a guide, with my clients, regarding the design of the gardens.<br>
            <br>
            The path was my focus - that is, how we move through space as we go from garden area to garden area. Having been a writer for Horticulture Magazine, at that point, for about 10 years, I wanted to write a book about garden design but I wanted it to be universal, and your Pattern Language was my inspiration. I was struggling with exactly what to write about when because I wanted it to be a book with substance and be about something that was universal to all gardens.A few months after completing the garden in Northampton, I went to the Matisse show at The Museum of Modern Art in New York and there read a description of a painting in which the curator referred to the "itinerary for they eye" in this particular Matisse painting.<br>
            <br>
            In a flash, the subject of my book - a flash borne of The Pattern Language and Matisse - came clear: The role of the garden path in garden design.<br>
            <br>
            I wrote the book the following year in a white heat and it has sold over 40,000 copies and shows no signs of diminishing in sales. I wanted you to know of this story, because I think you may well have influenced far more people than you realize.<br>
            <br>
            My very best wishes to you, and thank you,<br>
