          Our first exploratory idea of making Main Street truly unique and attractive for people all over greater Dallas, is to work with water and a series of small squares.
          <ul>
            <li>Imagine that there is a chain of small squares running the length of Main Street. Each is really small. They are spaced out evenly, perhaps on ever block, perhaps about two blocks apart</li>
            <li>All in all, along the 3.5 mile length of Main Street, This means there might be as many as thirty of them -- though there will certainly be gaps.</li>
            <li>Secondly, imagine water, a chain of stepped lakes, following the contours, and running for a good part of the length of Main Street.</li>
            <li>And imagine this chain of lakes, lined with shade and trees, so that the pedestrian space, all along the water, is the place that people think of, and go to.</li>

  </table>This particular solution may not be the right answer to creating a single visionary center that takes on the whole length of the street, and attracts visitors from all over Dallas and the southwest -- but <i>something</i> like it must be done.
