It is an intimate journey which reunites our internal experience with the external world so as to create wholeness in the reader. It is written in painfully precise language in which the future of society has the potential to be written.</td>

If its profound argument -- that order in both nature and in what we build are essentially the same -- is ultimately understood and accepted by serious readers it may prove to be one of the most consequential works Oxford has published in all its 500 years.</td>
