        <h4>Examples of what we mean by life and by good buildings are illustrated in many places on this site. All of them share, with nature, this character that every part, no matter how ordinary, and no matter how much it resembles other parts and other places, is magical, and can become an object of love for us. That happens because the uniqueness of every bush and every leaf, affirms and reaffirms, in every atom, and every cell, our underlying uniqueness.</h4>

        <div align="center"><img src="h-leaves.jpg"></div>
        <p>In all traditional environments -- boats, buildings, rooms, paintings, gardens, windows, roofs, materials, roof tiles -- this underlying variation and sameness, combined as nature combines them -- are re-affirmed. The elements are simple in appearance, but vary endlessless, and in varing as they do, like nature, they reaffirm the foundations of the human spitir.</p>
        <p>When this is lost, as it has been lost in the 20th century -- human beings are in peril, and depression, madness, anomie, despair, are not far away. They are caused, in essence, by the surroudnign image of a despairing circumstance, in which hotels, houses, apartments, offices, light fixtures, McDonalds hamburger places, , bricks, windows, panels, and modules, are identically repeated, and where, people too, are then thought to be ciphers of no importance that are identifically repaetd -- and where, then, the soul of man is in great danger of being lost.</p>
        <p>Our effort, on this website, is to regenerate, and generate for the first time, a living world in which the qualities of nature appear in every part of the built environment, and in which we make, therefore, for ourselves, a world which can be truly loved.</p>

        <p>Have a look. <a href="../otherarchitects/otherarchitects.htm">There are pictures of work by architects around the world who have found ways of making life</a>. It seems to us that these works are similar in character, or method, or philosophy,to the buildings we have been trying to make ourselves. In other places we show examples of <a href="../projecttypes/projecttypes.htm">things we have built during the last thirty years</a>. We plan a new section showing <a href="../messages/inpreparation.htm">work done by architects and builders using the pattern language and other tools we have made available in the past.</a></p>
        <p>We plan another new section showing <a href="../messages/inpreparation.htm">work done by users</a> themselves using, by themselves, the pattern language and other tools we have made available.</p>
        <p>We will definitely begin a section showing works by members of the builders network, so that the overall work of our network becomes visible. And we may start a section called "work in progress" describing projects we are currently working on.</p>
