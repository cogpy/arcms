        <p>The off-beat, syncopated subdivision of lots which has been described in chapter 1 must be supplemented by a very particular vision of the streets. In modern subdivision and urban developments, streets have become impersonal, too wide, dangerous, and unpleasant. Certainly they do not have the pleasant, heart-filled character which is necessary to provide the backbone of social life in the neighborhood, which is, in fact, their major function.</p>
        <p>The character of the streets in the neighborhood may be summarized by the following specifications:</p>
        <p>1. First, all internal streets are relatively narrow.</p>
        <p>2. There are three or four main streets, with a maximum width of 7 to 10 m.</p>
        <p>3. The minor streets, which provide access to most of the houses, are 5 to 6 m wide. This is intentionally narrow. It permits access by car, but strongly restricts movement of cars, so that high speeds are impossible, the streets are safe, and they will tend to be dominated by pedestrians, and be pedestrian in feeling.</p>
        <p>4. There is no explicit provision for parking. Gross over-provision of parking has destroyed residential areas in most parts of the world. Experience shows that adequate on-street parking, even on very narrow streets, can provide quite enough space, and the resulting congestion is absolutely insignificant, given the low volume of traffic. In fact, it even tends to create a further atmosphere of safety by slowing things down.</p>
        <p>5. There is no distinction between sidewalks and street pavement. The narrow street, whether it is paved or unpaved, is intended to mix pedestrian traffic with very slow-moving cars and parked cars.</p>
        <p>6. This attitude toward the streets is also fundamental to the Latin American--and specifically to the Venezuelan--free and relaxed attitude toward the car, in which the car goes everywhere, can become the center of a conversation, singing, or a shared beer... but it encourages this modern, free-and-easy attitude toward the car without allowing the car to dominate the streets and make them empty of pedestrians.</p>

        <p>Beyond these specifications, which describe the physical and functional nature of the neighborhood streets in gross terms, we must now concentrate on the vision of the streets, which will ultimately give the neighborhood its character.</p>
        <p>The streets are dominated by the following features:</p>
        <p>1. Long walls between houses, so that the street is an enclosed and pleasant place.</p>
        <p>2. Trees planted along these walls, behind them, hanging over into the street, and giving shade and softness.</p>
        <p>3. House fronts appearing in the long walls, from time to time, so that house fronts form about two-thirds of the total frontage of the streets.</p>
        <p>4. All house fronts opening onto the street.</p>
        <p>5. Visions of front entrances with small courtyards visible beyond, and gardens opening out beyond these courtyards.</p>
        <p>6. Ornamented facades of houses helping to form the street.</p>
        <p>7. Brightly painted house fronts using the wonderful bright colors of the Zulia region.</p>
        <p>All these aspects of the street, which are so necessary to make them come alive, are subsidized by a special program of subsidies, which has already been described in chapter 3. Thus the walls between houses, which help to form the street, the trees planted along these walls, the ornaments on the house facades, and free paint for each family are all provided by the central administration of the town under the direction of Proguasare.</p>
        <p>A vision of Guasare with these features: <img src="vision.gif" width="400"></p>
        <p>100 houses, all with gardens, banana trees, etc. The houses are brightly colored, painted with wonderful Maracucho flair. Streets feel created by plants, trees, etc. of front gardens. There are walls, so front gardens which create streets are partly hidden, but enough open to create life in the street.</p>
        <p>Streets are also positive spaces for working on cars, sitting out, children playing, etc. Each house enters into a courtyard, which is an internal patio, as in Pompeii. Beyond the internal patio is a mysterious opening into the garden beyond, which has profuse vegetation. Each house is placed in relation to its lot so as to have the cool breeze blowing through it. Streets are all relatively small in scale.</p>

        <p>In order for the streets to succeed beyond the vision which has been described in section 2, it is necessary that every part of every street be positive, in the character of its space.</p>
        <p>This concept has been described in some detail in <b>A Pattern Language</b>, under the pattern Positive Outdoor Space (pattern #106, pages 516-523). We shall now summarize this character in the specific detail required by the streets of a neighborhood.</p>
        <p>First, it requires that the entire street system be built up of a sequence of spaces, each one of which is perceived and felt as a whole entity in itself. We may also describe this feature by saying that each part of the sequence is a space which is recognizable as a "center."</p>
        <p>Diagramatically, we may show this idea in the following way:</p>
        <p><img src="positivestreet.gif" width="500"></p>
        <p>This shows how the entire street system of the neighborhood is made up of a sequence of positive spaces, or centers.</p>
        <p>In order to achieve this character, it is necessary that the planning administrators pay specific attention to the character of these centers at the same time that the individual houses are being designed.</p>
        <p>In short, our experience shows that it is an absolute rule that this positive character of outdoor public space cannot be created as a plan, or in plan form, at the time of the original subdivision of lots. It is a detailed act of design and construction which must go hand in hand with the actual design and construction of individual buildings.</p>
        <p>We may summarize this point in the following phrase: In order to succeed in the creation of positive outdoor space in the street system, each center must be designed and built with the same care that individual houses are designed and built. The individual centers of the street system are the physical counterpart, in the public realm, of what the houses themselves are in the private realm... and they must be made with the same care and concern for the subtleties of their physical design and construction.</p>
        <p>Each one of these centers will be created incrementally, from the building increments around its edges. Each building increment, around the edge, and other building elements, like walls, gates, trees, paving, will contribute in a definite way to the formation of the specific center they belong to. The building increments which come early in the development of the center will hint at its formation; others which come later will strengthn it, and the rest will complete it.</p>

        <p><u>The main square of the neighborhood</u>, probably the biggest center in it, and the focal point of all activities, will be established early in the development of the neighborhood. The first houses in the neighborhood will be built around it, and especially at the points which pin down its corners and the places where the secondary streets start. By the time the first increments of the houses that face the street are built, the square will be established as a place with a positive shape.</p>
        <p>The main square will not be fully established as a center until the public building of the neighborhood is built there since this building will give the main square its scale and its feeling of publicness. The construction of the wide sidewalks in front of the houses, the paving of the square and the trees, lights and benches in it will also be among the most important increments to be built, since without them the square will not really exist as the main center and the most public and alive place in the neighborhood.</p>

        <p><u>A secondary street of the neighborhood</u> is made of sections of street, each one of them rather long and straight. The making of one of these individual sections of a secondary street, each of which is a center, is very important in the process of the development of the neighborhood. The formation of a center along a secondary street will start with the first house increments to be built along this part. This part of the street will be pinned down and established as a center after about 70% of the houses have their first house increment along the street almost completed, and the front garden wall built. Another important feature of a section of a secondary street is the system of points where smaller streets start off from it; they are spots of activity, smaller centers which open off the bigger center. These points will be developed rather early in the development of the secondary street, even before the smaller streets are fully formed. They are points of repose along the street, with gates that emphasize the beginning of the smaller street, and with some intense lighting and small sitting places.</p>
        <p><u>The smaller streets and paths</u> are made of secitons of streets which are much shorter than the secondary streets: each one of them adapts its direction to the configuration of the site and the layout of the lots in a more relaxed way than the secondary streets. A section of a smaller street which is a center, with its distinct beginning and end, will be made through the following steps:</p>
        <p>a. It will have to connect with the previously established street section of a secondary or of a smaller street in such a way that a natural continuation of the street network is established, and also so that this new part of the smaller street will be a distinct entity of urban space. This will be made through a change of direction, or through a change in the width of the street, or through both of them.</p>
        <p><img src="gate.gif" width="500"></p>
        <p>b. The first houses to be built along a part of a smaller street should pin down the beginning of the street taking into consideration the parameters described above.</p>
        <p>c. Since a part of a secondary street is rather short, 3-5 houses along each side, its making is a matter of a short period of time. Garden walls will contribute to the formation of these parts of the small streets as much as buildings themselves. Therefore, they should be one of the first increments of the houses to be built.</p>
        <p>d. A part of a smaller street will have to adapt its formation to the configuration of the site. An unexpected change in the slope on the site might suggest the building of some steps that could function as a small sitting area in the street, or if the slope is pronounced, or if there is a change in the view, this might imply the end of this part of the smaller street, and the beginning of a new part of street in a different direction.</p>
        <p>What makes any one part of a street a true center is the fact that the part is distinct, with its beginning, its end, its direction and width, and at the same time its feeling of belonging to a larger network of streets. A part of a street cannot be a center unless it has a positive shape. The positiveness of the shape is a function of the relationship between its length, its width, its changes of direction, and its position in the whole hierarchy of the neighborhood's street structure.</p>
        <p><u>Small squares</u> will be created along the secondary and smaller streets. They will usually come in between two distinct sections of street, and they are part of the street network. Their shape is defined to a large degree by the direction of the streets that merge into them, so that the square forms a natural continuation of the street network. It is a place of repose, a place to linger. Its size will vary depending on the hierarchy of the street along which the square will be created. A small square along a secondary street is larger than a small square along the smaller streets and paths. The formation of a small square depends mainly on the building of 3-5 houses and their garden walls around it. By the time the first increments of these houses are built, together with their front garden walls, the small squares will become real places. However, for a small square to become a livable place for sitting and gathering, or for children to play, some further consideration has to be given to them. Trees, benches, pavement, a small shop with a covered front veranda for shade, a small water pond or fountain are things that will contribute to the making of quiet and intimate, alive small squares.</p>

        <p>The beauty of each individual street and square in the neighborhood is the outcome of the care and love with which each house front, each garden wall, each door and window, have been made. Each one of these elements contributes strongly to the making of a public place which is alive and which has a strong individual character that emanates from the acts of building of the people who live around it.</p>
        <p>The building of each house, and the making of each one of its elements and details have to be full-hearted. They should be guided by a clear intention to make the house beautiful in itself and harmonious with what exists around it. Venezuelan tradition has manifested this attitude in many neighborhoods in Maracaibo. The embellishment and ornament and color in each house have contributed immensely to the intimate and warm feeeling of these places. And it is this element and this attitude towards building that must manifest themselves in the construction process of the Guasare houses.</p>
        <p>On the following pages we will outline briefly those elements of the house which will give a final but important touch to the making of streets and squares which are alive and personal in feeling.</p>
        <p>THE FRONT OF THE HOUSE</p>
        <p>The front of the Guasare house has a strong character. The sala, with its large vertical windows, the tall and elaborate entrance door, the high roof parapet exemplifies some of the dominant features which make the Guasare house.</p>
        <p>The front facade of the house is articulated with great care. A pronounced base in each house, simple boundaries around the entrance door and the windows, small ornaments on top of the important openings and on the parapet make each house unique. And above all these features comes the color that emphasizes the articulation of the facade through the interplay of two contrasting colors, one strong and bright, the other light.</p>
        <p><img src="front.gif" width="500"></p>
        <p>FRONT GARDEN WALL</p>
        <p>The front of the lot is always enclosed by a wall, the house forming a part of this wall. In particular, the closed wall will help to create positive urban space in the street.</p>
        <p>The front garden wall is punctured at certain points with openings, like the porch, or the main entrance and the secondary entrance. The wall does not have to be made of block from bottom to top; it may be half height, and the top may be a wooden fence. It is important, however, to create the feeling of a continuous wall which helps to shape the street.</p>
        <p>The wall may be plastered and painted. Also, next to the wall, there will be trees which grow with their crowns extending over the street, giving the street more enclosure, shade, and a distinctness of its own.</p>

        TREES ON PRIVATE SPACE FOR PUBLIC USE</p>
        <p>Kevin Lynch has observed that trees in public areas (on streets) are not taken care of very well, but that trees on private ground are better cared for. It seems that the most important factor for trees to grow well in this area is their proper watering, which families tend to do for their own trees. The observation of housing areas in and around Maracaibo shows a sea of trees in private gardens between empty streets without trees.</p>
        <p>In order for trees on private land to be effective in creating public space, they have to be planted close to the front wall, inside the lot, in such a way that the crowns can contribute to the public area, enclosing the street and giving it shape.</p>
        <p>This seems to be a very common feature, which can be observed, for example, in Santa Lucia, Maracaibo, from the top of the church.</p>
        <p>ORNAMENTS</p>
        <p>Ornamentation on houses, mainly on the front of the house and on the front garden walls, is a common feature of Venezuelan culture. One can often see front walls being plastered first, before other walls, even painted before other walls have been plastered, and with some ornament over the main entrance.</p>
        <p>The essential point of ornamentation is to emphasize functional as well as spatial centers, important elements of the facade, like the front entrance or the front windows, but also floors and ceilings inside the rooms, and columns of the patio.</p>
        <p>In the houses of Maracaibo and its surroundings, we can find ornaments around the main door, and parapets on the top of the front wall. Also a large variety of ornaments can be found made with open stones for ventilation, placed high in the walls. Porch floors sometimes have tiles, and columns have simple bases and capitals.</p>
        <p>One of the most impressive ornaments, functionally as well as spatially, occurs in the ceilings of older houses, where traditional roof tiles together with wooden supports make a beautiful ornament, and at the same time create very efficient ventilation by letting the hot air out without letting the rain in.</p>
        <p>Ornamentation is not merely a matter of beautification; it is a matter of emphasizing the main centers in the house.</p>
        <p>COLOR</p>
        <p>Color is an essential element of the Venezuelan cultural tradition. There seem to be two factors which make the application of color to houses very beautiful.</p>
        <p>Careful observation shows that the most pleasant and harmonious colors on houses are obtained when the larger area of the wall has a light color, and the smaller parts, like the window frames and the door, have a darker color. The other way around does not work as well. Imagine, for example, a house facade with two colors, white and dark brown. If the main area of the facade is dark brown and the door and window frames are white, the house facade as a whole is very dark and unpleasant. If, however, the main area or the wall is painted white and the door and window frames are painted dark brown, then the house feels light and beautiful. This rule is applied in the successfully painted houses.</p>
        <p>Secondly, beautiful color is often created by color contrast. This simply means that opposites on the color circle are applied on one house facade, as for example, blue with yellow, red with green, etc.</p>
        <p>There are many beautifully painted houses in Venezuela where one can observe the use of both factors at the same time: light color on the main area of the facade and darker color on the smaller areas like the window frames together with color contrast, like a very light whitish yellow on the facade and a darker blue on the door and the window frames.</p>
        <p>Although there are many other observations which one can make about the colored facades of Venezuelan houses, and about practices which make house facades beautiful, the simple application and combination of these two rules will tend to produce a pleasantly painted house facade. Since the beauty of the front facade is very important in Venezuelan culture, each house may have color on the facade, many perhaps following the two rules described above.</p>
