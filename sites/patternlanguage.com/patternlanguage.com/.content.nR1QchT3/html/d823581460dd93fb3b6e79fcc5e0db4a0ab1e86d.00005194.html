          <h4><i>Everything, down to the fine grain and smallest detail finds its form through its unique adaptation, interaction, and suitability to where it is. The infinite variety created by unique adaptations is the source of beauty, joy, and life.</i></h4>

        <h4>Look around you. Take half a dozen daffodils, half a dozen children, half a dozen cottages from the Cotswald region of England. Of course the daffodils (or children or cottages) will be similar in many ways, but within that similarity, you see that each is unique. The exact place of the daffodil, the surrounding plants, the soil and sunlight affect the form of the blossom. Each cottage, although similar to the neighboring cottage, has found its own relationship to the hills and valleys. Each child's development has depended on the same steps of the DNA process but each is a unique creation. That each spot, each creature, each artifact we make, be unique and uniquely suited to its place is our most important responsibility.</h4>

        <p>When this responsibiity is lost, as it has been lost in the 20th century -- we are in peril: depression,anomie, and despair, are not far away. They are caused, in essence, by the surrounding image of a despairing circumstance, in which motels, tract houses, cubical apartment buildings, windowless offices, are made of thoughtless modular widgets,identically repeated, and where, people too, are then thought to be interchangeable. We cannot be or become ourselves. We lose our essence, or to use and old fashion word, our souls.</p>
        <p>Our effort, on this website, is to regenerate, and generate for the first time, a more living world in which the qualities of natural infinite variety appear in every part of the built environment, and in which we make, therefore, for ourselves, a world which can be truly loved. Many people, each in a unique way, are already involved.</p>

        <p>Have a look. <a href="../otherarchitects/otherarchitects.htm">There are pictures of work by architects around the world who have found ways of making life</a>. It seems to us that these works are similar in character, or method, or philosophy,to the buildings we have been trying to make ourselves. In other places we show examples of <a href="../picturegallery/picturegallery.htm">things we have built during the last thirty years</a>. We plan a new section showing work done by architects and builders using the pattern language and other tools we have made available in the past.</p>
        <p>We plan another new section showing work done by users themselves using, by themselves, the pattern language and other tools we have made available.</p>
        <p>We will definitely begin a section showing works by members of the builders network, so that the overall work of our network becomes visible. And we may start a section called "work in progress" describing projects we are currently working on.</p>
