        <p>The proposal for housing and neighborhood development which has been presented in the preceding pages will require very careful implementation. It is obvious, both from the instructions we have been given by ISA and Corpozulia, and from the philosophy expressed in the principles which guide these pages, that the process of house growth and neighborhood development we have defined is intended to be selfsufficient. It is intended, therefore, that this process be a Venezuelan process, operated by Venezuelans, for their own benefit.</p>
        <p>However, the process is unfamiliar, and in certain respects complex. We believe that it will be necessary that we ourselves play a role in this development in order to guarantee the practical implementation of the steps necessary to make it succeed.</p>
        <p>According to the projected growth, Guasare will reach its target population in about twenty years, by the late 1990's. We believe that the CES will need to play a role in this development for about the first five years. During this five-year period, we propose to manage the practical steps necessary for success in such a way that gradually, during the five years, the process becomes more and more autonomous. If we start work in 1984, then by 1989 the process will be completely autonomous, and entirely in the hands of the local Venezuelan officials from Guasare, from Proguasare, from Corpozulia, and from Carbozulia.</p>
        <p>For the sake of concreteness, and in order that the practical issues are clearly understood, we shall now define the outline of the type of agreement between Corpozulia and CES which will be necessary in order to let us take the next steps in carrying forward this program of development.</p>

        <p>1. <u>BACKGROUND</u></p>
        <p>This agreement between CORPOZULIA (or possibly PROGUASARE), henceforward to be known as the Client, and the CENTER FOR ENVIRONMENTAL STRUCTURE (henceforward to be known as the Construction Manager), will provide conditions under which CES will manage the construction of the first two neighborhoods of GUASARE new town, according to the general principles already stated in this plan.</p>
        <p>2. <u>TASKS</u></p>
        <p>The tasks to be completed by CES will include the following:</p>
        <p>A. Layout of neighborhoods and lot subdivision for the first two neighborhoods. This will be done on site in Guasare and then surveyed.</p>
        <p>B. Establish a local office in Maracaibo/Guasare, staffed by Venezuelans, who will be trained on the job, and will be capable of carrying on the work after CES leaves the project.</p>
        <p>C. Negotiate with Venezuelan construction companies, and construction managers to set up a construction management system for the construction of infrastructure and houses in the neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>D. Define construction details for the houses to be built in Guasare. This work will include full-scale mockups of new details, materials, and negotiation with manufacturers to produce any necessary new components.</p>
        <p>E. Establish a workshop in Guasare in which these full-scale construction details can be developed.</p>
        <p>F. Develop details of the house layout process with tests done with Venezuelan families to perfect the details of the house layout process.</p>
        <p>G. Negotiate with officials of Corpozulia and INAVI for the loan arrangements necessary for construction of the first neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>H. Set up a builder's yard in the first two neighborhoods, with materials supply and technical help necessary for construction of self-help components of the housing in the neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>I. Work closely with officials of Carbozulia to arrange various details of the program.</p>
        <p>J. Lay out the houses of the first two neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>K. In view of comments made by Managers of Carbozulia, it is possible that it may be desirable for CES to develop and build a third neighborhood of an entirely different economic character for the managers of the mine, since officials of Carbozulia have privately expressed the opinion that the neighborhood layout would be more suitable for managers than the houses along collector roads.</p>
        <p>L. In order to avoid a schizophrenia between the architecture of the miners' housing and the housing of the neighborhoods, it may also be desirable for this program to be set up jointly, between CES and Samper in Colombia, with very strong cooperation between the two teams, and some shared work or responsibilities. However, this matter has not yet been discussed at all between CES and Samper.</p>
        <p>M. Actual management of all construction in the neighborhoods during the first three to five years. It should be emphasized that after preliminary negotiation with construction companies in Venezuela, it may be desirable to set up an independent construction management system. In this case, CES will take responsibility for hiring the managers of this system, training them, and working with them during the first few years of production.</p>
        <p>N. CES involvement will cease only at that moment when the first two neighborhoods are at a very high level of completion. Since some houses will develop gradually and may require five to seven years for completion, a gradual sloping off of CES involvement is needed, with some participation even after five years. The intention of this contract will be to give CES a very high level of responsibility in managing the process. This will require a high level of confidence from Corpozulia, and a rather free hand for CES in making basic decisions about management, within the scope of the two neighborhoods.</p>
        <p>3. <u>COST</u></p>
        <p>The total cost of this program will be on the order of about one million dollars. The budget has not been calculated in any detail at all, but this figure is provided in order to give Corpozulia an early estimate for use in planning for the next stage.</p>
        <p>This price works out at about $3,000 per house, which is too high for a steady state cost, but appropriate for a first stage cost. The high cost is created by the necessity of a joint office in Venezuela and California, and by the high cost of travel and communication.</p>
        <p>It is intended that the management system which will produce later neighborhoods, in the steady state, after the initial training period by CES, and after CES leaves the project, will run about $1,500 per house.</p>
        <p>4. <u>CONDITIONS</u></p>
        <p>It should be understood that the type of conditions which are envisaged by both parties consist of a continued presence of CES in Maracaibo and Guasare over a period of three to five years. In this respect it must be understood that the very restrictive conditions imposed by the previous contract will make proper development of the next phase completely impractical.</p>
        <p>In particular it is necessary to guarnatee the following points:</p>
        <p>A. That CES has sufficient funds to maintain and staff an office in Venezuela for the duration of this contract.</p>
        <p>B. That airplane tickets and long distance telephone calls are freely available within the terms of the contract, so that whatever necessary communication between California and Venezuela can take place freely, and whenever necessary, without any complications.</p>
        <p>C. That payment of all bills must be absolutely prompt, according to contract. Since the previous contract experience makes it clear that Corpozulia may have difficulty living up to this type of agreement, some new arrangement in which funds are deposited in some escrow account, ahead of time, will be necessary.</p>
        <p>D. There must be a small group within Corpozulia itself or within Proguasare which is absolutely committed to the implementation of the principles described in this report. In the present contract there has been something of a one-sided situation, in which CES has been called upon to undertake the necessary work, with reasonable support from ISA, but without any clear-cut advocate group in Maracaibo actively pushing for implementation of these principles. We have accepted this as a condition which was perhaps inevitable in the first phase of such a project. However, in order for the project to succeed in its main implementary phase, we would need a guarantee, and a practical demonstration, of a strong change in this condition.</p>
        <p>These four conditions may be summarized in the following fifth condition:</p>
        <p>E. Successful implementation of this project requires a state of absolute trust between the members of Corpozulia who are directly involved, and the members of CES. This trust must exist at a genuine human level, and must extend itself not only to actual behavior of individuals and professional conduct, but also to the wording of the contract itself. The present contract was written in a language based on mistrust. Once again, we accepted this condition temporarily, since there had, until then, been no basis for trust established. However, we must emphasize deeply that the project itself in its practical phase cannot succeed under these kinds of conditions. The project will be very difficult and will succeed only if it is based on serious intention by a small group of people in Venezuela who have the stamina and the power to see it through.</p>
        <p>Once these five conditions exist, there can then be a genuine partnership between CES and Proguasare, in which financial and contractual conditions take a secondary role to the development of a successful work effort. We recognize that these conditions may sound abstract, and that they may also violate certain habits which have been established in the upper echelons of Corpozulia. However, our experience in other international projects shows clearly that these conditions are absolutely necessary. If they are not met, then it is fruitless to begin the project, since absence of these conditions will certainly cause the project to fail.</p>
        <p>We wish to emphasize our sincere belief that this project is too difficult to be done under "normal" conditions, and can succeed only if genuine trust exists at the deepest possible level, and if, as a corollary, the four conditions stated above can be met, directly and openly, with understanding, and as required.</p>
        <p>Since the directors of ISA or Proguasare themselves may not have the power to meet these conditions, we wish to emphasize that these conditions must be discussed at the highest level and understood and acted upon by top management of Corpozulia.</p>
