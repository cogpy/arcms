        <h2>Steps From A Sketch To A Coherent Form</h2>
        <p>The whole process may be thought of as a gradual straightening and fitting of rectangles to the sketch which has been made, so that the sketch is straightened (90% but not 100%), and so that the rectangles which are formed form coherent positive space, and so that all boundaries, edges, joints, tops, bottoms, also become good centers in their own right.</p>
        <p>Note: this straightening process is very different from the kind of thing that happens in Broderbund Home Architect, or in Chief Architect or in Autocad. In all these essentially CAD-like systems, the representation of a building is assumed to be specified by a series of geometric "slabs" (parallelapipeds or 3-D rectangles). This very bad assumption is what has driven much of the 20th century ugliness, and has also driven and been driven <i>by</i> the fabrication of slabs at all levels of modern mass-constrction -- prefabricated concrete walls, kitchen cabinets... windows, doors, roof planes, driveways, are all conceived, <i>and made</i>, as standardized slabs. That is where the harm comes from.</p>
