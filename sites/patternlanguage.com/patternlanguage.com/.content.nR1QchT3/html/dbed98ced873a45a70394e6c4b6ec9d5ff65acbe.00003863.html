          <h4><b>WARNING<br>
          COMMON MISTAKES MAY BE HAZARDOUS TO YOUR COMFORT AND BUDGET</b></h4>
          <p><br></p>
          <h4></h4>
          <p>Here is the common reasoning to avoid: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I have a tract house&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; My kitchen is ratty&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I need to fix it up for re-sale value&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go to Home Depot or MFI&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at new appliances&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I look at new cabinets&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; A saleman shows me a CAD design of new cabinets to replace the old ones with same size and same placement&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I agree to spend $10,000&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life is no better&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nor is my kitchen, except that it is cleaner</p>
          <p>A lot of money is spent but not on the things that could really make a difference. People do not know, that they can move sinks and plumbing with only a small cost. People do not know that they can move doors, change and enlarge windows, for relatively small costs. These expenditures will often bring you much more comfort than a new appliance or fancier cabinets.Consider the kitchen as a place you want to spend time, bring in the light you need and a comfortable place to sit and work. It is a no brainer for a salesman to sell replacement cabinets, so get the professionals to really work with you in making your kitchen TRULY comfortable.</p>
