    <p align="left"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif">The tree of my title is not a green tree with leaves. It is the name of an abstract structure. I shall contrast it with another, more complex abstract structure called a semilattice. In order to relate these abstract structures to the nature of the city, I must first make a simple distinction.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">I want to call those cities which have arisen more or less spontaneously over many, many years <i>natural cities</i>. And I shall call those cities and parts of cities which have been deliberately created by designers and planners artificial cities. Siena, Liverpool, Kyoto, Manhattan are examples of natural cities. Levittown, Chandigarh and the British New Towns are examples of artificial cities.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">It is more and more widely recognized today that there is some essential ingredient missing from artificial cities. When compared with ancient cities that have acquired the patina of life, our modern attempts to create cities artificially are, from a human point of view, entirely unsuccessful.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Both the tree and the semilattice are ways of thinking about how a large collection of many small systems goes to make up a large and complex system. More generally, they are both names for structures of sets.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">In order to define such structures, let me first define the concept of a set. A set is a collection of elements which for some reason we think of as belonging together. Since, as designers, we are concerned with the physical living city and its physical backbone, we must naturally restrict ourselves to considering sets which are collections of material elements such as people, blades of grass, cars, molecules, houses, gardens, water pipes, the water molecules in them etc.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">When the elements of a set belong together because they co-operate or work together somehow, we call the set of elements a system.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">For example, in Berkeley at the corner of Hearst and Euclid, there is a drugstore, and outside the drugstore a traffic light. In the entrance to the drugstore there is a newsrack where the day's papers are displayed. When the light is red, people who are waiting to cross the street stand idly by the light; and since they have nothing to do, they look at the papers displayed on the newsrack which they can see from where they stand. Some of them just read the headlines, others actually buy a paper while they wait.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">This effect makes the newsrack and the traffic light interactive; the newsrack, the newspapers on it, the money going from people's pockets to the dime slot, the people who stop at the light and read papers, the traffic light, the electric impulses which make the lights change, and the sidewalk which the people stand on form a system - they all work together.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">From the designer's point of view, the physically unchanging part of this system is of special interest. The newsrack, the traffic light and the sidewalk between them, related as they are, form the fixed part of the system. It is the unchanging receptacle in which the changing parts of the system - people, newspapers, money and electrical impulses - can work together. I define this fixed part as a unit of the city. It derives its coherence as a unit both from the forces which hold its own elements together and from the dynamic coherence of the larger living system which includes it as a fixed invariant part.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Of the many, many fixed concrete subsets of the city which are the receptacles for its systems and can therefore be thought of as significant physical units, we usually single out a few for special consideration. In fact, I claim that whatever picture of the city someone has is defined precisely by the subsets he sees as units.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Now, a collection of subsets which goes to make up such a picture is not merely an amorphous collection. Automatically, merely because relationships are established among the subsets once the subsets are chosen, the collection has a definite structure.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">To understand this structure, let us think abstractly for a moment, using numbers as symbols. Instead of talking about the real sets of millions of real particles which occur in the city, let us consider a simpler structure made of just half a dozen elements. Label these elements 1,2,3,4,5,6. Not including the full set [1,2,3,4,5,6], the empty set [-], and the one-element sets [1],[2],[3],C4],[5], [6], there are 56 different subsets we can pick from six elements.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">Suppose we now pick out certain of these 56 sets (just as we pick out certain sets and call them units when we form our picture of the city). Let us say, for example, that we pick the following subsets: [123], [34], [45], [234], [345], [12345], [3456].</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">What are the possible relationships among these sets? Some sets will be entirely part of larger sets, as [34] is part of [345] and [3456]. Some of the sets will overlap, like [123] and [234]. Some of the sets will be disjoint - that is, contain no elements in common like [123] and [45].</font></p>

In <a href="DiaA.shtml"><b>diagram A</b></a> each set chosen to be a unit has a line drawn round it. In <a href="DiaB.shtml"><b>diagram B</b></a> the chosen sets are arranged in order of ascending magnitude, so that whenever one set contains another (as [345] contains [34], there is a vertical path leading from one to the other. For the sake of clarity and visual economy, it is usual to draw lines only between sets which have no further sets and lines between them; thus the line between [34] and [345] and the line between [345] and [3456] make it unnecessary to draw a line between [34] and [3456].<br>

    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">As we see from these two representations, the choice of subsets alone endows the collection of subsets as a whole with an overall structure. This is the structure which we are concerned with here. When the structure meets certain conditions it is called a semilattice. When it meets other more restrictive conditions, it is called a tree.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The semilattice axiom goes like this: <i>A collection of sets forms a semilattice if and only if, when two overlapping sets belong to the collection, the set of elements common to both also belongs to the collection.</i></font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">The structure illustrated in diagrams A and B is a semilattice. It satisfies the axiom since, for instance, [234] and [345] both belong to the collection and their common part, [34], also belongs to it. (As far as the city is concerned, this axiom states merely that wherever two units overlap, the area of overlap is itself a recognizable entity and hence a unit also. In the case of the drugstore example, one unit consists of newsrack, sidewalk and traffic light. Another unit consists of the drugstore itself, with its entry and the newsrack. The two units overlap in the newsrack. Clearly this area of overlap is itself a recognizable unit and so satisfies the axiom above which defines the characteristics of a semilattice.) The tree axiom states: <i>A collection of sets forms a tree if and only if, for any two sets that belong to the collection either one is wholly contained in the other, or else they are wholly disjoint.</i></font></p>

    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">However, in this chapter we are not so much concerned with the fact that a tree happens to be a semilattice, but with the difference between trees and those more general semilattices which are not trees because they do contain overlapping units. We are concerned with the difference between structures in which no overlap occurs, and those structures in which overlap does occur.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">It is not merely the overlap which makes the distinction between the two important. Still more important is the fact that the semilattice is potentially a much more complex and subtle structure than a tree. We may see just how much more complex a semilattice can be than a tree in the following fact: a tree based on 20 elements can contain at most 19 further subsets of the 20, while a semilattice based on the same 20 elements can contain more than 1,000,000 different subsets.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">This enormously greater variety is an index of the great structural complexity a semilattice can have when compared with the structural simplicity of a tree. It is this lack of structural complexity, characteristic of trees, which is crippling our conceptions of the city.</font></p>
    <p align="justify"><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">To demonstrate, let us look at some modern conceptions of the city, each of which I shall show to be essentially a tree.</font></p>

And again, 'The communities themselves consist of a series of sub-units, generally with their own shops and schools, corresponding to the neighbourhood units.' The city is conceived as a tree with two principal levels. The communities are the larger units of the structure; the smaller sub-units are neighbourhoods. There are no overlapping units.

The physical layout of the plans, and the way they function suggests a hierarchy of stronger and stronger closed social groups, ranging from the whole city down to the family, each formed by associational ties of different strength.</font></p>

A village is made up of a number of separate closed groups of this kind.</font></p>
          <p><font face="Arial, Helvetica, sans-serif" color="#000000">But today's social structure is utterly different. If we ask a man to name his friends and then ask them in turn to name their friends, they will all name different people, very likely unknown to the first person; these people would again name others, and so on outwards. There are virtually no closed groups of people in modern society. The reality of today's social structure is thick with overlap - the systems of friends and acquaintances form a semilattice, not a tree (<a href="fig10.shtml"><b>Figure 10</b></a>).</font></p>

In this respect Manhattan has more overlap in it than Greenbelt. And though one can argue that in Greenbelt, too, friends are only minutes away by car, one must then ask: since certain groups <i>have</i> been emphasized by the physical units of the physical structure, why are just these the most irrelevant ones?</font></p>
