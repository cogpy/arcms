        <td width="700">
          <span class="h4class" style="color:333333"><span style="font-size:110%;background-color:ff0000;color:cccccc">A User-Initiated Process of Development</span></span>
          <p>This is a process intended to create small-scale infill of groups of small houses, in small parcels of land which lie between development areas, and are close to existing communities or on their fringes.</p>
          <p><span style="font-size:110%;background-color:ff0000;color:cccccc">The presumptions are as follows.</span></p>
          <p></p>
          <ul>
            <li>An average modest person (Mr Jones, not a developer) might typically be able to buy a piece of land anywhere from one acre to 10 acres. Averaging 4-5 acres. Typical price of such a parcel, at $8-10,000 per acre, would be about $40,000.<span style="font-size:80%;background-color:0000bb;color:cccccc">(see appendix 1 for details)</span></li>
            <li>Let assume this Mr Jones, buys such a parcel, or obtains an option on it.</li>
            <li>He shows willingness to create a land trust, which will leave the land in a non-profit trust (will be done according to pre-drawn legal document costing him nothing, and free legal advice provided by the county).</li>
            <li>Under the terms of this land trust, 50% of the land, the most beautiful part of it, is dedicated in perpetuity, for preservation as open land, used either as nature, or for small-holding agriculture, or food production.</li>
            <li>First, the beautiful part, the 50% to be kept open, is chosen, and designated on the deed.</li>
            <li>Very rough pedestrian streets, streets and boundaries are then recorded</li>
          </ul><span style="font-size:100%;background-color:ff0000;color:cccccc">The remainder -- the buildable part of this land -- is then to be configured by means of the following step-by-step process, as follows:</span><span style="font-size:100%"></span>
          <ul>
            <li><span style="font-size:100%">An announcement regarding ground rent. The Jones Trust, chaired by Mr Jones, announces the monthly ground rent, per sf, which will be charged for use of land in the buildable part.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size:100%">Tenants -- would-be house-owners -- are invited to come forward, and join the Trust.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size:100%">Instead of buying the land, they sign up for the right to use the land in perpetuity.</span></li>
            <li><span style="font-size:100%">As would-be participants come forward, they are shown the loose layout of streets, common-land, and boundary of the buildable area, and select a site. They are free to choose position on a first-come first served basis, and may choose size and configuration according to rules laid down by the Trust <span style="font-size:80%;background-color:0000bb;color:cccccc">(see appendix 2).</span></span></li>
            <li>Broadly, they will set the boundary of their chosen parcels, with stakes, and these stakes will be recorded.</li>
            <li>Parcels would tend to average about 1/4 acre: but the actual results would depend entirely on peoples individual judgement. and could run as low as 2000 sf, or as high as one acre.</li>
            <li>The would-be owner will at the same time, define the position and rough size of house he intends to build</li>
            <li>The process is simultaneously recorded on the web, and players, new houseowners, are able to see the plan evolving as new families join.</li>
            <li>Once the families are assembled (not necessarily all, but up to some percentage), the housegroup goes for planning permission.</li>
          </ul><span style="font-size:100%;background-color:ff0000;color:cccccc">After permission, the individuals begin laying out their own houses, for themselves.</span> <span style="font-size:80%;background-color:0000bb;color:cccccc">And individual house layout process may be seen in appendix 3</span> <span style="font-size:90%"></span>
          <ul>
            <li>This process is communal, but without forced community, People act individually, not in any forced kind of overly social atmosphere.</li>
            <li>Yet at the same time, there is a relationship of each individual's action to the whole, thus creating a sense of mutual responsibility and community while leaving people and households their privacy of action.</li>
          </ul>
