            <p><font color="brown">I guess what I have in mind is pretty simple. If some of us are sufficiently of like mind, that we know, through feeling, what a living environment is like -- then we can simply make sure that the knowledge of what it takes to make such an environment can be spread around, discussed, shared, and implemented.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">Most important, is that the knowledge of what to do, is something ordinary, and that in principle everyone can understand it, and wishes to understand it.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">But of course this naive wish must be strong enough, to defeat entrenched forces of self interest -- money, power, development, special interests, and politics. Is that anything more than a naive dream?</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">I do believe so. I believe it is likely that in the age of the Internet, this age-old dream of humanitarians, can now come about --</font></p>
            <h1><font color="brown"><i><font color="blue">because the distribution of information, through the Internet is powerful enough to put sufficient (modest) tools in people's hands, so that even small people, with not much individual power, can defeat settled interests, no matter how huge they are.</font></i></font></h1>
            <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
            <h3><font color="brown">Let me tell you a story.</font></h3>
            <p><font color="brown">A few years ago, my colleagues and I were in a situation planning a new community for a few thousand members of a neighborhood in Nagoya who had asked me to help them. As part of our effort to help them, we undertook a survey which asked people in existing apartment buildings the following VERY simple questions.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
            <ul>
              <li><font color="brown">Would you like your own small garden?</font></li>
              <li><font color="brown">Would you like to live nearer to the street, or further from the ground?</font></li>
              <li><font color="brown">Would you like a small street outside you house which is safe from fast moving cars?</font></li>
              <li><font color="brown">Would you like more sunshine and more light in your apartment?</font></li>
              <li><font color="brown">Would you like to be able to influence the layout of your apartment</font></li>
              <li><font color="brown">Would you like to have all these things without increasing the price of construction, and without changing the density of development?</font></li>
            </ul><font color="brown">These questions were relevant because I had published a new kind of housing plan plan in which all these qualities were possible at the same price, and at the same density, as the horrible high-rise apartment blocks typically then being built in Tokyo and Nagoya. Our survey, which had a predictable outcome, would simply have opened the door to this new kind of plan and building program.</font>
            <p><font color="brown">The government in Nagoya then spent enormous effort, to prevent this survey (to one hundred families) from taking place (they failed in the end, but managed to prevent it from happening for almost a year). WHY? Because the questions are simple, and the answers obvious. Neither the government nor the companies building large apartment buildings, wanted these questions to be asked because once it became clear that 100 families who asked these questions had a virtually unanimous voice, it would then be more difficult for them to continue in business.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">In short, the entrenched interests who control the environment today (including, I am afraid to say, some architects), keep their game going, because simple and obvious opinions like this are suppressed.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">I believe that it is reasonable to say that with the power of the net, when we learn to encourage thousands, and then millions of people to express their views, it will become more and more difficult for the present development machine to keep on churning out its stuff, without paying attention to these matters.</font></p>
            <p><font color="brown">In the end, what we used to call the power of the people, will prevail.</font></p>
