          <i>The following passage, part of Book 2 of the Nature of Order, is taken from a recently given talk in Istanbul at the Department of Architecture, Istanbul Technical University, Turkey</i></font>
          <p><font color="brown"></font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">In order to describe the fundamental language scheme that I believe to be necessary, I shall use material from Book 4. The material hinges on the concept of beings, a slightly fanciful, but nevertheless succinct, more accurate, and more expressive way of talking about living centers. It is described in fully in Book 4, chapter 5.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Briefly stated, we may say that a successful building, one which has life, will be entirely made of beings, so that every part, and every part of every part, and every part between two parts, becomes a being -- that is to say -- a living center.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">In order to describe the creation of a building in these terms, we may then, reformulate the idea of the iterated application of the fundamental process unfolding centers one by one, already described in chapter 7, as a system of transformations in which each transformation introduces further beings into the unfolding structure.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">In the accompanying sketch, and photograph, from eastern Anatolia, we see an ancient tower in the town of Mardin. As we see in my sketch, this tower is made of a profusion of being-like entities. It is because of this attribute that we may say that as a work of architecture it is good, and that because of this, that it has life. The lecture hall gallery, depicted in the second picture, has no such beings -- is not good architecture, and has virtually no life.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Very succinctly indeed, we may say that a form language able to produce life, will always be a system of transformations which allowed living beings to be created, one by one. Any building which comes as output from such a language -- if properly applied -- will have life. Any building made in some other framework -- for example in most of the conceptual frameworks of the late 20th-century -- will not be able to have life.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">It must be noted that this statement is abstract and highly general. It certainly does not commit an architect to some form of romantic historicism. There is nothing about this statement which requires that buildings have historical antecedents or allusions. Indeed, buildings made with an eye to the past will all too often fail to have living beings -- and hence will fail to be alive -- because the process of historical reproduction somehow turns living vivid, living structure sour -- it congeals without having real force, or real vivacity.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">It must be understood, once and for all, that the buildings -- despised by too many modernistic theorists -- which DO have living beings in them, and dismissed by them as being about history -- are not about history at all. Modern architecture turned the entire architectural process on its head, because it managed to confuse people into thinking that all buildings that have beings in them -- living centers -- must inevitably be historical, or imitations of history.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Nothing could be further from the truth. This one lie, caused, in a sense, the whole sorry upset we now look back on as modernism and post-modernism.</font></p>
