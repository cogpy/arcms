  <h4>Here you will find a sample of five patterns concerning houses, collected together, as a sample of how the online Pattern Language works. Just as in the full Online Pattern Language, these patterns are interconnected, and you can move from one to the next using the links within them, or you can navigate using the bar to the left. We hope you find these patterns helpful, and interesting. We will be posting the entire Pattern Language, in the same hyperlinked format, within a matter of a week or so. This Online Pattern Language will be available to members of PatternLanguage.com.
