          <p><font color="brown">From the Carpet Dealer, Alberto Boralevi, Florence</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">The most interesting and original explanation of the value and of the reasons of the mysterious spell of carpet fragments for us today was probably given by C. Alexander. In the introduction of his catalogue and book, A Foreshadowing of 21st Century Art, New York-Oxford 1993. As an architect he writes of having become more and more aware that the beauty of a building depends mainly on the on the fine structure, i.e. the minimal details. "What is often called the 'detail' of the building - its fine structure - is not some kind of icing on the cake, but its fine structure, the essence of what it is, and how it makes its impact upon us." According to Alexander, genuine antique carpets are the only art form in which the care and organisation of details reaches the highest level. The module of a carpet is as small as its knot - about an eight of an inch. A single knot is meaningful; a carpet fragment will already express its feeling and the colour.</font></p>
