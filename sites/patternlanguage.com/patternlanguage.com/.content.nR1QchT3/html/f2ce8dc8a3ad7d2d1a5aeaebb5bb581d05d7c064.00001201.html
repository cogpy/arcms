                As far as architecture or building is concerned, l suppose what your comment about 'reuse' alludes to for me is a number of things, and l would like to pursue the notion so l can put my finger on precisely what is in that notion, and what gives connection to software and architecute in relation to patterns.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In architecture is reuse just the literal meaning that patterns can be reused time and time again in varying contexts, that they have historical validity and that they carry the analysis of the problem and the solution to the problem simultaneously?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l find it interesting to hear that software maintenance costs more than software design and development? Why? And why are you intrested in this maintenance or reuse?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">And you're right, my pattern about the timber, concrete, slate floor is probably really a application rather than a pattern.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">What would happen if we took the patterns that you have proposed which run through my example of the floor, and come from that direction to see how they manifest in a solution.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I suppose when l made the sketch for this particular type of floor, l was responding to a number of problems whithin a given context. And when l say it was in part to the difficulty l experienced in working with thermal mass walls (particularly earth brick) l was quite serious.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So what do l know about this?<br>
                I can understand how patterns help me to build things, and l can understand how they in part give the context of the solution and in part are the solution for that context.<br>
                But how do patterns relate to prior givens, or to the broader context from which they emerge?<br>
                If my example of timber, slate, concrete floor is a product of a number of patterns happening, how do l retrieve those patterns from that process and test their validity or usefulness?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">How are patterns generated? How do they get their validity? How do they get their place in history?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Pronob, the example you give of patterns flowing through one another is understandable.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Vasko,<br>
                My interest in Patterns is from the point of view of reuse of design. However, at the same time I am interested in giving patterns some kind of expression that shall help us better maintain or reuse an existing design. I am not sure how much<br>
                of this design reuse or maintenance aspect come into play in Architecture but it is certainly a major issue in the software field where in general software maintenance cost more than software design and development.<br>
                Starting from the example you provided:the pattern of timber,slate and concrete floor, first thing I shall<br>
                suggest that this is not a pattern, but an application of a pattern. After looking at this example,some one can do a floor sketch for a library room with book shelves along the four walls and some display item in the middle. The wooden part of the floor is layed parallel to the four walls,idea is people,without shoes, will stand mostly next to the book shelves when they are in this room.The library room still implements the pattern that you suggested. But what can be the description of the pattern you suggested? Before I put my suggestion about that, I like to draw your attention to the fact that I have got my own definition of patterns which I have also used in my site papers and other softwares. In my model, pattern is nothing but a consequtive sequence of the focus of the mind. A collection of several related focus is called a Scene. In reality a Scene can be a free flowing description of the solution as you presented. A description like that in general has several patterns flowing through it.<br>
                Coming back to the example you provided, I can suggest several patterns[my brand of patterns] flowing through it.<br>
                e.g "Comfortable Floors For Solar House" is one, others can be "Maintaining thermal mass in a solar House", "location of Solar rooms in temperate climate" etc.<br>
                My point is all these patterns exist simultaneously in your particular example.It may appear that these descriptions of patterns are focussing on the problem rather than the solution like a more accepted version of pattern does. But I have no problem with that -I can easily call the patterns like "Floor with , timber, concrete ", "Wooden Floor for thermal retention" ,"North Face for Solar room" etc.<br>
                My point is, it is essential to give Patterns a "standard 'normalised' form" with simplicity of concept.<br>
                If we accept the above approach, the pattern "Comfortable Floors For Solar House" can be thought of as a narrative with consequtive sections on various aspects of the title of the pattern. For example there can be section on the comfort aspect of the floor, concentrating on relation between floor material and blood flow through the feet. There can be a section on materials possible for floors. Point to note none of these sections will have only the single pattern in question. Each section will have other numerous patterns flowing through it just like your example does. What I am saying is,<br>
                Patterns can be compared with strings of multilayered beads hanging together from the neck. A pattern can be thought of as a string going through large beads where each bead has a number of thread penetrable wholes. Each string passes throgh some selective beads but all together the beads hang from the neck of the wearer as if stuck on a single wide band around the neck.<br>
                Vasko, if you are happy with this simplification of patterns I can go on discussing other aspects of patterns -of how we can use them through<br>
                software tools to aid in architecture work in dynamic design environment [patterns are not static design aspect any more,they would define the action at almost every little design step]. Here I shall wait for your thought before I proceed further.<br>

                How do we recognise patterns so that we can articulate them in design?<br>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">For example, l think l have discovered, or rediscovered some patterns in my work.<br>
                They are:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Seasonal pond<br>
                Flywire enclosure<br>
                Shady area on the south<br>
                and l have a pattern for a timber, slate and concrete floor.<br>
                These three materials can be combined together to make a floor that looks beautiful and gives you good thermal mass.<br>
                You can make a floor like this for a passive solar house, it is probably best to make this floor in the north facing rooms that get best sunlight. In the past passive solar buildings used concrete slabs to get thermal mass for the building for both winter heat storage and also for summer heat absorption, thereby having a moderating effect on the internal temperatures.<br>
                But concrete slabs can also be cold in winter and hard and not very comfortable to walk on.<br>
                So l drew a sketch of a floor that had a band of polished cocrete around the room, roughly about 600mm wide, sometimes it can be a metre, depending on the size of the room. Then you have a row of green slate tiles inside this, about 250mm for their width, and within the green slate tiles you have a recycled redgum or jarrah floor recessed into the slab and flush with the tiles or concrete.<br>
                This way you get the best of all worlds. You get the thermal mass that for your building and where you sit mostly, you have a timber floor that is warmer and easier on your feet than concrete.<br>
                l made this pattern after l built my first loadbearing mudbrick house. This is when l realised how difficult it was building with mudbridks.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l am trying to make these patterns for a cool temperate climate like here in Melbourne.</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Vasko,<br>
                Thanks for your last two responses.<br>
                I shall start with a brief background where I am coming from. Although my interest in Patterns has been through my interest in Software Architecture, it is something else which attracted me to Software Architecture in the first place.<br>
                That something else includes an knack towards observation of the process of human understanding [if there is any process at all].<br>
                In this domain I believe patterns have a major role to play. After carefull consideration of what goes on in different computational activity, I strongly believe the only<br>
                way we can take leverage of this ever-present 'Patterns' is by building all our computational tools like software programs on a different kind of computational platform which I called Content based computing. If you have a spare time you are most welcome to read a paper I wrote on this -it is in my site-the address of which appears below.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Your narration of a practicing architect's encounter with Patterns and other human beings has to some extent supports my belief about Patterns. Patterns,I believe can be and should be<br>
                made part of the language between the architects and as well as between the architects and their clients.<br>
                Expression of patterns has to be something which we understand just by knowing english -one need not be trained in any particular discipline to understand patterns. For example "going to school" can be a pattern. Also patterns can be nested e.g. 'going to school' can have another pattern built into :'catching the transport'.This may sound like I am trivialising patterns by ignoring such pre-requisites like context,problem,forces of nature etc.<br>
                But we need some formal framework to represent every pattern in a way that patterns are just not documentation of good practices but patterns become the drivers of design in the tool sense as well. However that does not mean patterns loose their subjective gravity. All it means is patterns become the vehicle of transactions between people in the society, between professionals.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Coming back to the architect's service ,imagine we have a standard convention where we describe a structure by a short expression of the very human activity that goes on<br>
                in and around that structure. Imagine there is a world-wide standards data base of such expressions-something similar to domain names for internet addresses. Against the short description,in this case, the data base has some graphical description of the pattern of that structure it is referring to.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">For example we can describe two garden styles:<br>
                one is "Indian Puja Garden" and the other is "Japanese Tea".<br>
                Now these two structure for gardens expresses certain combination of facilities ,like a group of people to<br>
                do some ceremony or practice, the first being where a group of 10-15 people sit together on aplatform and a priest sit on an elevated level.<br>
                The tea garden is more for a group of 5 couples where each couple has a separate place to sit.<br>
                Both those styles of garden might include [nested] a pattern like "free-flowing fresh air". With easy access and representation of such patterns and their graphical views , Patterns will become more part of the transactions not only between architects but also between architects and clients. Without my background in architecture these examples are quite superficially made up. But I suppose you can get the idea of what sort of role for patterns I am thinking of. It may appear this is a long way from the state today-but in the internet age no one really knows the speed of rush to the future.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">l would like to try and answer your last question from your most recent entry;<br>
                How can patterns help improve architec services?<br>
                l am trying to answer this for my own sake, because l am also trying to understand the answer to the question.<br>
                l work for a private architecture firm and have been trying to introduce the patterns into the services of our firm.<br>
                So far l have had more luck with the clients than with the directors.<br>
                In my mind your question has two parts to it, at least.<br>
                The first part can be answered directly to the question, and this is much easier for me to answer.<br>
                Patterns can help architect services in many ways. One of the most important ways they can help is that they provide a common language between the architect and client, as well as to any other people involved in a particular building project like the builders and tradespeople.<br>
                Patterns can help the architect specifically by unravelling to the architect the organic nature between built structures and the way humans inhabit space and time in their myriad of actions from the most mundane to the most profound.<br>
                Patterns in this sense give human actions quite a primary role as determining influences in the way buildings and human habitations take their shape.<br>
                Today however, architects begin design the other way around. They start with a 'bright' idea, often this is a form, a shape, a geometry of some sort, then they squeeze the living actions of people into the those particular spaces.<br>
                According to patterns this is just not the way things happen, they have never happened this way for humans in the past.<br>
                The other side of your question for me is why have patterns not been embraced or used more widely by architects and other design and building professionals?<br>
                l have only known about patterns for a short time myself.<br>
                l handed one of the patterns books to my director who is in his 50's and was around at the time when patterns were emerging in the USA. He had not heard of patterns but was quite enthuasiastic and inquisitive about them and wanted to have a look.<br>
                He flicked through the pages , and have you ever seen someone throw a dog a handfull of rabbits guts, how it lunges eagerly at them initially, and then realising after having half swallowed a mouthfull, that it does not really like the taste, then recoils and backs away, growling and convulsing as it shakes the contents right back out. Well this is what my director was like. And like the tempted and curious dog,skirting around afterwards and nipping at and licking at the what it had just expelled, so too my director skirted around the book and ate one page here and one page there, but not the whole lot.<br>
                l suppose it had that raw, human, fleshy taste to him. Too strong. He later described it as too 'deep'.<br>
                l am still trying to still understand what he did not like about the patterns.<br>
                Our firm is a medium sized firm, with building consultants and architects and surveyors all working together. Most of the blokes, particularly the directors are suspicious of most things, particularly these pattern things.<br>
                The women on the other hand, who are mostly in secreterial and admin. roles think that it's all fine and in fact quite important.<br>
                The clients who l have been giving the patterns to, want patterns with cream on top.<br>
                And then there are the cleaners who come in at the end of every day to clean our crap and cups and food everywhere. They hardly speak a word of english but understand these patterns. They reckon that;<br>
                "Yeah, ofcoarse you have to plant fruit trees and vegetables in your backyard, these patterns of yours are nothing new, we know them already, our parents have been doing it like that for a long time you know".<br>
                So now my clients are asking for more patterns, and the directors are seeing these clients eating these 'rabbits guts' and their eyes bulge and water and their cheeks puff up and glow... cause its all a bit hard for them.<br>
                l keep telling them we can improve our services with these patterns. And they're not that stupid that they can't see cause they really are quite canny and shrewd.<br>
                My best understanding of why they don't like the patterns at the moment is based on superficial appearances of their behaviour. They're trying to work out if these patterns are going to be a staple diet in the future, and should they start learning how to eat them?</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Reading the comments so far I guess every one has been interested in pattern from aechitecture-related perspective. My experience with arcitecture has been as an user of services from architects, and that too is not terribly positive one-I spent around $10,000 on some architectural plans for the renovation of the house I live in. The architects produced about 5 sketches starting from initial sketch to developed plans and because I had to postpone the project because of personal circumstances I just ended up paying the prorata on the completed task, the total architecture cost being 9% of the estimated budget of the project. This may have been far more interactive and suggestive phase of the potential of the place I live in, had the architects approached the issue from a different perspective. To start,they might have suggested a few alternate ways I can set up my back yard.Like how it can add value not only to my property but also adds some attraction to the neighbourhood.They could have made some alternative sketches about the way we can use our swimming pool-not only just for swimming but also as a calming agent for us and our tenanats who live next door-or how we can have alternative entertainment area for sitting under the tree or next to swimming pool etc.Instead the architects interest was totally focussed on two things-one is our buget and the other was what we ourselves want. The fact is budget is to some extent related to the potential of the building structure and ourselves, not being architects, not necessarily know what is possible given the position of our land and neighbourhood.<br>
                This is where patterns may come handy-if the architects were follower of patterns it would have been quite possible for them to give us some possible alternatives without charging $10,000. I guess same thing is happening at other places as well where people are building some thing because that would presumably fetch highest financial return or it is the cheapest to build. In this rush other issues and mental preferences does not get much chance to play.<br>
                I am a software pwerson by profession. I can probably imagine systems holding information on patterns -but will like to hear the point of view of practising architects -how do you think pattern can enhance the architecture service in general? Can it be used to protray a possible lifestyle the future structure will help to bring in?</font>

                Never used a chatroom before so here goes.<br>
                Fascinating book..quite prescriptive telling us how to design window frames! Pattern Language has been around for so long. It must be a very quite revolution because you never hear of it. I was introduced to it by Warrick Rowell down at Rosneath Farm in Dunsborough, WA. Warrick is a real fanatic about it and is designing the whole built environment on pattern language principles.<br>
                As an architect, I am keen to explore the concept of "humanising spaces". Delivering such an outcome through our builder-based construction economy though seems to be a major obstacle.</font>

                My main interest with patterns have been on the representation of patterns and in making them part of our lifestyle rather than keeping them a subjective and abstract entity. Surely in that approach we have to be cautious -we should make sure patterns do not become a syntax for writing a piece of software-rather our main focus should be how we can make it easier for people in different walks of life to follow patterns to enhance their life, education,understanding of the nature of things.</font>
