The one thing that I noticed when I was with the chairmaker is how absolutely focused and relaxed I was working with him.

                so great to get a response! Yes, the ideas are wonderful. The Timeless Way of Building is one of the most inspirational books I have ever read and has the power to change lives I feel. Out with the ugly and souless and in with human architecture. I'm hopeful that with the oil economy coming to a close and the inevitable transition to greener ways of life, including greener buildings, CAs ideas may find greater favour. We will see. I'd be interested to hear your perspective.</font>

Despite being unaware of these concepts, I can see that my house lives on a number of levels, probably because it was literally put together by my wife and I with no building knowledge other than what we read in books, no skills and hardly any money. Coming upon CA's books only recently I became re-enthused about building and now plan to make improvements incorporating some of the patterns. I joined the site today but I must say, what a dissapointment on many fronts. This chatroom is nearly dead. What's going on? And man, the website should reflect the philosophy, ie it should LIVE. It gives the impression of being looked at halfheartedly by the webmaster once in a blue moon. If we are truly going to change the world we'd better get a rocket up our collective arse real soon! Some links with the permaculture people would help I feel. Perhaps transitionculure.org as well. I make these comments in the spirit of constructive criticism. I wonder how many months will go by before anybody reads them.</font>

I am during my degree project in which I use the "advices" from the book.. what is easy to understand when to hear the idea.. Vertical Parks, new public space.. as answer for no space in big cities for green fields.. I know You are strongly in ideas that book contain thats why I would like to ASK YOU FOR HELP. I hardly can find any materials that show that the LACK OF GREEN SPACES IS A PROBLEM.. and WHAT CITIES HAVE THAT PROBLEM..

For those who are unaware of it, the new Los Alamos National Security Science Center has to be the eyesore of the century. Incredibly this building won the New Mexico Best of 2005 Design-Build Project, Southwest Contractor Magazine Award. It was a design build project by HDR, Inc.</font>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The fully offensive nature of the beast can only be seen by visiting Los Alamos, and seeing it from a distance. It proves that the tradition of fascist architecture is still alive and well. The building resembles the bridge of an Imperial Star Cruiser, which can only be deliberate since this is the building where the nations nuclear weapons stockpile is designed. It “commands” the long narrow mesa upon which Los Alamos laboratory is built. The actual architect clearly knew what he was doing, and the obscenity of the joke is that none of the reviewers of the project got the joke. The thing about fascist architecture is that it appeals to, well, fascists, and speaks volumes about the various managers and adminstrators who reviewed and agreed to the project.</font></p>

If you have read Hermann Hesse’s poem Hours In The Garden then you have an idea where we are trying to go, (on a small scale!), with our backyard. So, today we weeded the vegetable garden. Right behind it is an area which is trying to become an area for meditative retreat – the farthest corner of the yard. We know that it suffers the same problem our rose garden did before we screened off the potting area from it. It has no strong separation from the business of the vegetable garden and therefore has difficulty achieving that quality of repose. So we are planning a privet hedge. And it just happens that we have some privet to spare in another area that is begging to be cleared of it!</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">You have many interesting strands going here.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I can't compete with you two in terms of antiquity but I can throw some weight around when it comes to moderation; I've built a 360sq.ft. straw bale cottage and a 720sq.ft. timberframe/straw cabin. But I want to hear more about the French house that started as a prehistoric cave dwelling! That sounds wonderful.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I like Steve's idea for a point system that would free people to build organically as prescribed in these books. I would advocate simplifying even further so that a few prerequisite principles, if followed, would suffice. Building incrementally, over time, with local (or at least simple) materials, and with input for redesign from people who use the place (and so people must use the place), and finally having the work done by aesthetically informed designer/builders who are in dialogue with their community is what's essential. TPL would be an invaluable perennial tool for these builders but I would guard against it becoming canonized or codified. I think they suggest this in TPL--that these are a preliminary set of descriptions. I often think of additional patterns that are not covered by the original 253 entries. The patterns that resulted in Steve's Puymeras house flowed through the people who built it, not in bureaucracy. I like the scale of the hut (or cave dwelling?) for many reasons including the freedom from building codes.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Your point re TPL being an early hyperlinked text is interesting. I think it is a an attempt to apply a scientific matrix to these organic, humanistic, artistic patterns that developed over all pre-industrial time. It was written for a scientific, computer generation and reflects this in its structure. It is a compelling attempt to validate timeless wisdom with contemporary systematic discovery and organization. Like science, it has power in its reductionism--"these are the pieces of beauty"--and in that process risks losing sight of the whole.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The Timeless Way of Building and parts of the Nature of Order are poetry, and incantation, and meditation on the whole. I think in both, CA mimics his approach to building with his prose: layering, repeating, stacking, "gradual thickening." Perhaps Timeless is an early, intentionally vague attempt to suggest the "Quality that has no name" and the Nature of Order is a later, more refined attempt to not only name it but to describe its taxonomy. The Patterns are tangible results of a process related to this Quality. By going directly to the patterns, we take shortcuts to functional shelter and landscape--the accumulated knowledge of our forbears.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">When I first read Timeless I was struck by how it reminded me of Buddhism and Taoism. "The timeless way..." Perhaps the ultimate distillation of the quality CA is getting at is mindfulness. If we merely approach our controllable surroundings with mindfulness then perhaps we will embody the timeless way of building with our improvements. Having resources such as a copy of TPL on hand often helps. The hard part is that to be mindful, one must be engaged, and our modern lives squeeze out time with our landscape, garden, patio, and craft. Circumstances team up on us even when we're committed.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I enjoy reading how Pete and Maryellen used a pattern to establish their garden wall. Of course it also sounds like the area has been changing ever since they moved there and this is the organic progression of how they live in that place.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Did you fill in the pool? How did the rose garden come to replace the pool?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I like how this topic (beauty) turns people's prose to poetry: "And finally, this very spring, they needed the strong Boundary to differentiate the two centers in order for each to go deeper into the states to which they attain."</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I would like to offer a position for the superiority--or at the very least, the value--of the hand-drawn plan. Like maps, plans drawn by hand offer many advantages. They familiarize one in a unique and needful way with the details and nuances of a structure. They highlight important features that only the human artist can recognize--they communicate better information. Human to human communication is retained in the hand-drawn map. It is less so with computer-generated plans and maps.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I've worked creating maps using GIS and I'm impressed with the power and utility of the technology. I am also aware of its limitations in terms of being a digitized representation several generations removed from the original landscape. You end up with extreme precision for calculation and analysis of a facsimile of questionable accuracy. People are seduced by the data and the images and forget that they're looking at something other than the landscape.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Anyway, hand-drawn plans may just be an advantage when you go talk to the officials. Take your copy of TPL. Tell them that in order to maintain the essence of your very old place, you have to pursue these pre-industrial arts. The medium will be the message.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I've been working on a map of my place in Pennsylvania for years.

                Hi Pete<br>
                Thanks for the quick reply. We appear to have a couple of other things in common - noted from your message on that chat room that you live in an old American Colonial farmhouse dating back to about 1732 - our house in England is the largest section of the barn of an old farm dating from about that period. (Note "section of barn" - we mostly live in SMALL houses in Europe!) Also your comment about your office - "Light from two sides, window seat, thick walls" rang a couple of bells too as did the bit about the piles of stuff blocking the windows. We don't have the big spreads of land that you guys have though!</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I was also intrigued by your remark about the asterisk coding in APL, after I first read the book many years ago I had forgotten a lot of the detail but did remember that bit - used to refer to them as "Alexander points" - and say that there basic rule in planning etc ought simply to be that any development had to have at least a minimum number of "patterns", and you got more "credit" for having more asterisks. Anything with more than 100 Alexander points would automatically get approval!</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">One other thing that struck me was that APL was actually the first example I ever came across of a hyperlinked document, in that the references at the end of each pattern meant that you could read the entire book in any order and it would still make perfect sense - not bad for a book written in the 1970s (and which looks like came from the 1920s).</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Here in New Jersey, spring is all over the place. It is a great year for lilac and dogwood. Maryellen and I spent the weekend erecting a wooden board fence to separate our rose garden from our potting table and tool storage area. The result of this (173) Garden Wall is an electrifying increase in the profundity of both the chaotic industriousness of the garden work area and the serene formality of the rose garden. Separating these two very different garden functions is allowing each to be altogether alive without detriment to the other.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">But why did it take us so many years to recognize that the simple, easy to build wall would be so effective? It is because the two areas began their lives as one outdoor, inground pool area. Gradually, the area of the yard near the shallow end of the pool became a potting table/garden work area and the pool itself became a rose garden. The potting table area held all the tools and supplies needed to nurture the rose garden and all our other garden areas. The rose garden's formality challenged the potting table area to be more organized. As time went on and the two areas matured they no longer required the direct interaction to maintain their states.

                you know that I got your message. I will need more time to digest it.<br>
                I felt a sense of recognition in your remark about reading APL in cafés as<br>
                you traveled. I always seem to have one or the other of Christopher<br>
                Alexander's books with me to read at the odd free moment. Last spring I got<br>
                the Nature of Order series and read through it fast, (it took all summer<br>
                even so). Now I am re-reading it slowly and sharing it with friends.<br>
                What an interesting section you cite in book two. And just now I am looking<br>
                at the photograph of the highway knifing through downtown Providence. I<br>
                have driven that road several times and it really is a brutality to the<br>
                city. Clearly the mental images which made it alright and necessary to<br>
                build that way are not wholeness preserving.<br>
                At any rate, let us continue this conversation. And I will keep an eye out<br>
                for the drawing utility.<br>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Pete, your background as a programmer means you may have an idea about the problem I’m trying to tackle. In essence, I am looking for a small utility programme that simply doesn’t seem to exist at the moment.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am a (now retired) British Airways pilot living about 50/50 in the UK and France. As a pilot I was also heavily involved in avionics technical development, especially of flight deck instrumentation and information management systems, so have some experience of “user problems analysis”.<br>
                I have a shared holiday place at Lake Tahoe, and have many friends in<br>
                Northern California, including an architect/builder through whom I first<br>
                came across Christopher Alexander and APL. I’ve always been interested in<br>
                “places” and why they work (or don’t) and used to read APL sitting in cafes<br>
                etc in various parts of the world on my travels, and found the arguments<br>
                very convincing. I am currently in the middle of Book 2 of the Nature of<br>
                Order where I came across something which struck a particular chord and<br>
                caused me to revisit this website where I saw your message.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Now to the point. As I said, I live most of the time in Marlow England, in<br>
                a house that is part of an old farm building (barn) dating from about 1700.<br>
                I also have a house in a village in Provence in France, whose origins are<br>
                actually hillside caves dating back to prehistoric times, but most of the<br>
                main structure dates probably from about 1100 AD. This was originally 3 or<br>
                maybe 4 buildings built on different levels at different times and has walls<br>
                and floors up to 3 feet thick in places. We have had to do some work on both<br>
                from time to time and that is where the problem arises.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">To modify these old structures in today’s world you have to get all sorts of<br>
                permissions etc and that involves providing drawings and plans. Also it’s at<br>
                least useful to be able to do some planning on paper anyway! However there are of course no existing plans for such buildings – they just evolved over centuries or “unfolded”, as CA puts it the Nature of Order – and the walls are rarely straight.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have been searching for years now for some drawing software that would<br>
                enable me to make a reasonably accurate record of what the existing<br>
                structure actually is, so I can then see what is going to be needed to make<br>
                the modifications necessary. There appears to be nothing on the market that addresses this requirement, and we come back to very simple processes of tape measure, pencil, paper, eraser and photocopier to get something I can<br>
                work on.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">What I am looking for is in fact little more than a very basic geometry<br>
                utility which will enable me to do elementary triangulation and mimic<br>
                something a seven year old can do with a ruler and a pair of compasses:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Mark points A and B on a baseline<br>
                Draw arcs radius r1 centred on A and r2 centred on B (where r1 and r2 are<br>
                predetermined values)<br>
                Mark point C at intersection of r1 and r2 (user chooses one of two of course)<br>
                Erase arcs leaving points AB&C<br>
                Repeat for points D, E……<br>
                This must be done with the absolute minimum number of steps, because there will be a significant number of points to identify - perhaps up to 20 – C to X, say.<br>
                Join ABCD….X</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Ideally one would in fact simply enter the radii for each point in a table rather than actually drawing arcs.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have looked at numerous architectural / landscaping / remodelling / cartographic packages and as far as I can see, NONE of them addresses this user requirement. The closest is a very good general-purpose graphics package that handles vector graphics very well indeed, called Xara Xtreme, but their people are not interested in adding the feature I need.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am not to saying it the task is actually impossible in any known current package, but the number of steps such as mouse movements and clicks required<br>
                for each point makes it absurdly laborious, and the pencil & paper etc<br>
                routine is orders of magnitude less work to get the necessary end result.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The fundamental problem boils down to something that Christopher Alexander<br>
                picks up in Chapter 4 Section 1 of Nature of Order Book 2, “Why all<br>
                processes do not create life”. All existing packages have as their end<br>
                objective creating something new from a conceptual picture the user has,<br>
                according to a set of fixed and somewhat arbitrary rules. E.g. they start by assuming that walls are straight, of constant thickness, and usually set at right angles to one another. They also assume that a very high degree of accuracy is an inherently good thing and thus require it to be used throughout. This is completely the reverse of what is needed to record what already exists from historic times. So without banging on any more about the philosophical aspects of all this,</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I wonder if you either know of a package, or more significantly know how I could contact someone who might be interested in writing a utility, which does that simple task? There is, incidentally, a significant market for such a package in a number of business areas although most of the customers may be outside the USA. It would be useful to many homeowners and builders who have to deal with older properties, as well as real estate agents who need “quick and dirty” floor plans, gardeners and others who want to get make plans of their yards, and indeed anyone who has to deal with existing physical objects, as opposed to wanting to make new ones from scratch.<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Jeff,</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Thanks for your thoughtful reply. You know, I completely overlooked the asterisk coding scheme, although I am certain that I noticed it when I first looked at APL. Your description of the catch basin effect of today as opposed to that of the 1940's was helpful to me as were your observations of the current dynamic at work in modern cities. I hope to hear more of your thoughts.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My interest in APL began with a brief column in a software programming trade magazine. I bought the book and found it an eye-opener not so much from its applicability to software patterns but from its native point of view of architecture.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I began to read APL looking for clues to improved usage of our home and found an opportunity in the room I called my office/ study. It began as a place to write programs and to study but over time its role had expanded and had become an upstairs TV retreat and my wife's place to pay bills and answer email. The room no longer had the focus on programming I required. In short, a chaos of themes and poorly arranged furniture reigned.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">One day I decided to try to fix it. First - pattern 159, Light from two sides. Well, I had that but I had furniture and piles of things partly blocking them. By just moving existing things around I freed the view at both windows, implemented 180 window seat, and enhanced the impression of 197 thick walls.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">As soon as that occurred, I realized that the position of the room in the house was working against it as my programming workplace and very strongly towards a role as a den and household office. So I removed my programming related stuff out including my desk. As a desk for my wife, I installed a large simple table - a scaled down echo of the large table described in 139 farmhouse kitchen. It had plenty of room for Maryellen to spread out her stuff. We got rid of all uncomfortable seating and replaced it with a pair of ratty old mismatched ridiculously comfy chairs. The changes were electrifying! What a success. Now it is a pleasure to go there and watch movies or a TV show. Maryellen does all the bill paying, committee work, and online shopping there, with easy access to the kitchen and the laundry room.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">As for my stuff, well, a much underused room at the other end of the house seemed perfect for use as a study and programming workshop. It was being used for storage mostly so we emptied it, painted it, and installed a futon, a desk and shelves. It has wonderful light and a great position in the house. Maryellen and I both go there to do things of a quiet nature such as reading a good novel, or in my case studying things of a technical nature.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">From there we began work on our porch - it was 6 feet wide with columns at the corners. It was otherwise bare. We added a bench, a package table, a large wind chime, and planters at the base of one column. Suddenly it was alive!</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So, we keep an eye out for small changes that can be made to improve the life of the house and its gardens. A little here and there as inspiration and time allow.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am interested in #28 simply because I am trying to discern why some business districts nearby succeed and other do not. I am trying to understand my environment through the ideas in this book. I am not in a position to influence things at that level in a direct way but I feel that the more I understand the stronger y moves will be at the level where I do have influence.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">More, later. Thanks again for your response.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">After looking at this pattern (28 eccentric nucleus) again, I have a couple of comments and questions for you.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">First, I think it's interesting that the pattern receives one asterisk in the authors' system signifying that:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">"...we have made some progress towards identifying such an invariant; but that with careful work it will certainly be possible to improve on the solution. In these cases, we believe it would be wise for you to treat the pattern with a certain amount of disrespect--and that you seek out variants of the solution which we have given, since there are almost certainly possible ranges of solutions which are not covered by what we have written."</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have often pointed to this system of qualified certainty when responding to critics of APL who find it too absolute in language and attitude.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Second, this idea is based on research done in post-WWII London and other examples of older cities that haven't been formed exclusively in response to the automobile. I think the majority of American cities today exhibit the exact opposite pattern of business centers drawing "catch basins" away from the city center toward the periphery. They also draw on large suburban and rural catch basins that overlap more due to branding and consumer subcultures where people travel greater distances to get just the item, price, or atmosphere they seek.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Unfortunately, many urban centers are wastelands today. In other cases, they are being rejuvenated as "cultural districts" without serving the organic role of daily commerce and community. In rare cases they are being redeveloped as authentic centers under the rubric of new urbanism. Of course there are a few examples of cities that have retained the classic pattern described by "eccentric nucleus" with neighborhood markets, newsstands, book stores, and cafes that draw residents toward the city center.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In the best cities with which I am familiar, traditional centers are sustained by herculean efforts to keep shopping malls and big box stores at bay. Even in these cases, though, my own experience points to a more refined circulation pattern in urban areas based on specific, singular destinations (food co-ops, favorite restaurants, etc) and progressive infrastructure such as pedestrian zones and bike paths. If I can walk or bike someplace pleasant I'll go there even if it's further from home.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My questions are: why this pattern? Are you in the position to influence the planning of your community? Are you considering developing a business that would be influenced by this pattern? Finally, tell us more about your house and how/which patterns from APL have helped?</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">One of my favorite things about Alexander is how he democratizes "architecture" and points out the superiority of intuitive building--the timeless vernacular. I think that you (and many other people) can design and build your own shelter, especially since you're familiar with this website and the associated books.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am a designer/builder and although I grew up with a carpenter father, most of what I've accomplished I learned through reading and doing.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Here are a few suggestions:<br>
                1. Plan to build incrementally. Start with a small portion of your overall design and focus on developing your skills (both for design and actually building) on this project. Maybe this portion will eventually be an outbuilding, study, or shed, etc.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">2. Have faith in your ability to learn, adapt, and "satisfice"--a term Stewart Brand uses in How Buildings Learn to describe the process of making things good enough. Over time, like evolution, satsificing gradually results in the timeless buildings and landscapes Alexander points to in APL. You can learn by reading, asking those who know, and by "just doing it." I learned how to bake bread from a book and then later how to cut timberframes and build with straw bales from books. I learned how to make and apply earth plasters through helping a friend who had learned from someone else. Plan to learn what you need to learn as you go. Alexander basically does this and describes his process in his many examples.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">3. Since you're in an expensive building market, consider buying a timberframe or modular unit of some kind from a less expensive market in your region. This could get you started with a roof and basic structure that would be ideal for implementing Alexander's approach to on-site, experiential design for placing windows, doors, internal elements, landscaping, etc. It would also take some of the risk out of being a beginner builder since you wouldn't have to worry about structural safety so much.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have lots of ideas along these lines; let me know if any of this is helpful.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">You said you have no carpentry skills. I'm wondering if you read the section of the patterns that show how to construct thick walls using cement and forms. It doesn't take much skill, just an attitude to do it. Ken Kern wrote a book about building your own house and another about making a masonry stove. In the stove book he describes two middle age women without construction experience who set about to build a cement house and did so.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I bet you sew. That qualifies as at least some experience in my book. And I bet you cook. You can follow a plan, use tools to complete the task, measure, cut, and divide materials, and appraise quality throughout the task. Don't let a cultural bias toward women building hold you back.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">You know, about all that stone and stonework on your basement/garage there, have you ever heard of the poet Robinson Jeffers?

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">A couple new real estate things opened up around here, both with location problems. One, decent, pleasant, affordable across the busy street from Citgo; the other -- stunningly perfect: built up over the years into a hill, interesting windows, a casual plaza-like parking/walking area, a former inground pool full of frogs, a pottery studio, several outbuildings, a meadow! Right next door to some former greenhouses full of trash and the trash-filled parking lot of an oil delivery company. I'd never be able to let the kids out. Far from work & school & expensive, too.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">So, we recently revisited the idea of renting and building, but I'm a coward. And, although I know someone is going to do it anyway, I hate to be the guy responsible for tearing up the woods.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hunting for real estate can be a pain. So much of what appeals doesn't show on the listing data. (I chuckle trying to imagine some of the patterns being printed on the listing, like: positive outdoor space; half hidden garden; cascade of roofs.) Then you have to ponder the lending rate. Will it rise tomorrow? Is it better to jump on something with potential, or wait for something better??</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My purchase was almost accidental. My mother has owned a 10 acre property near Westcliffe CO for 30 years. We had tried to find it 3 times through the years and failed. I was never excited because I thought it was just scrub and sage and boring. We went on a Friday 2 years ago and visited the tax assessor and he copied a map highlighting the path. It is a beautiful property. Lots of pinon pine, a huge red cliff mountain to the west, and no neighbors visible from the land. I was excited and my mother said I could have it to build on. The next day she said I would have to share it with my sisters. I've always wanted to build a house but could not imagine how such a project could be shared. So I thought the best thing to do would be to buy my sisters out. I started looking on the internet for comparable properties in the immediate area. Thats how I found the property I ended up buying. It had a house that burned down, a good garage (24x36), well, septic, electric, telephone and a driveway. Electricity was more than a mile away on my mother's land. Telephone is up to her property line, but everything else would cost. I figured the price I paid was less than the cost of the same improvements on my mother's land.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have spent the 18 months since I purchased the land just cleaning up. I bought a small tractor and have moved all the debris out of the old basement. I did add some radiant foil insulation in the garage because I have been "camping" in there when I am on the property.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Because I am obsessed with building and feel like I may never finish at this rate, I am closing my business in Denver, selling my house, and moving up to the mountain. I am in a hurry because I want to get it on the market before the interest rate shoots up.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am an eclectic reader. I have read a few books about bees and making mead, and a chess book, but most of my reading has been related to building. In addition to the pattern language, I have read a couple books about solar designs, ferrocement water tanks, stonework (lots of stone on my property), and thinshell concrete habitats. I was fortunate to meet George Nez last year and helped him build a demonstration thin shell concrete roof for the University of Colorado. I struck up a friendship with him and have done more of these roofs including a demonstration on my own in Oregon this year.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am pleased that we have started a dialog here. I hope it encourages others to join in. I had hoped a practitioner would moderate and guide the discussion. Nevertheless, just the process of putting thoughts down in writing and getting feedback will be very beneficial. I hope it is for you as well.</font></p>

                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In New Haven County, we live in an over-developed hodge-podge of wall-to-wall neighborhoods, some charming from the 1900's, some sprawling from the 50's-70'5, some truly obnoxious from the McMansion vinyl 90's.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The only land available for development is scary (former landfill, high-crime neighborhood) or anti-social (clearing the few remaining woods to build in a McMansion subdivision). Ok, so you treat your lot with respect, but you have to look out the window at the neighbor's vinyl bonus room. Here, at least, re-using basically good housing is both a moral and an aesthetic decision.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I find the patterns really, really compelling. Any existing house might already have some small percentage of them going for it. Then, you remodel to get the ones easily added: porches, blurry boundaries with landscaping, farmhouse kitchen, filtered light, even I'm thinking, old folks' cottage.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">And, you have to live with what you can't get: light on two sides, for example -- a killer!</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The questions are, what to live with, and how expensive it is to get the rest.</font></p>

                My thought about using patterns to remodel is that it may take longer than building, or the temptation to dive in could undermine the larger perspective.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">For example, the kitchen on the 1 acre property is in great need of an update and would also be the most expensive room to update. While this may seem the most urgent, you may later decide it should be in another place.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">One of the problems with some of the old ranches is the house is usually just a rectangle. Floor plans weren't made considering any of the "patterns." This could take some thought to overcome.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I live in a ranch style now, and have spent 14 years working on it.

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Thanks, Gary. Yes, the colonial is two stories, and brick, and very tight on its lot. Worse, it's at the very top of the ol' budget.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The house on a street I called "tony," meaning "too wealthy and aware of its wealth for us," is nifty. It's got non-standard windows, a strange floorplan, a back patio surrounded by windows from some of the interior rooms; an attic finished into two more bedrooms gives you "cascade of roofs" and "couple's realm." It really WAS designed by its "users." They just kept adding on as their family grew. But, it needs expensive unromantic work: creepy wet cellar, windows & doors don't open, new furnace, paint, kitchen, probably roof. It is also priced as if the work were already done.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The brick ranch on an acre is the cheapest choice, and its mechanicals are sound. It is not cute, not warm. It has dreadful wall-to-wall everywhere and loud wallpaper, a sad 1960's kitchen with fake-wood formica cabinets. But, that kind of work can be fun. The house is rather poorly located: it has no wild places nearby, no community centers nearby (libraries, parks, etc.), and very little neighborhood. It's alone on top of a hill, on a through street with no sidewalks, but it backs up on a closed-loop neighborhood, where I hope, there are children, old people etc. We have three children, and we're used to sidewalks, passers-by, street life.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I don't know. Is a brick house hard to modify? Can't move doors, change windows? Start with an ugly ranch in an empty football field, end with an ugly ranch with a few charming features in a half-landscaped-because-we-ran-out-of-money football field?</font></p>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Hi Kathy and Luca.<br>
                Sorry to delay so long in response.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In the absense of a practitioner/moderator for this chat room, I'd like to suggest we just continue to discuss issues with our specific situations and hold out hope that a knowledgeable person will tune in.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Kathy, you mentioned an idea of a large barn in the oak trees. Is it to be a barn or a barn-like house? Will this be a second house, or a future permanent residence?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">It seems the distance between NY and TX adds challenge to your project. I believe many techniques for handling the TX climate have been erased from common building practice. I know of a person in that area that has just completed or is near completion on a cinder block home in the old Mission style. He has a photo diary online if you're interested.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I have worked on the problem posed in my first post. I stayed several days on my property with the patterns close at hand. I reviewed many patterns.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">In pattern 110-Main Entrance, it says "Place the main entrance of the building at a point where it can be seen immediately from the main avenues of approach and give it bold, visible shape which stands out in front of the building."</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Since my driveway wraps around the building site, it is possible to approach the house from either East or North. I must make the main entrance visible from both approaches. The North approach will provide a good guest parking area, a close-to-the-building parking spot for me and be closest to the main entry on the NE corner. The Eastern approach suggests a nice stairway from the lower level to the NE corner. I think this will be the best location for the entry.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Now I have another problem to pose:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">What should I do with the existing basement?</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Here's some background detail;</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The fire left a 27'x36' cinder block basement with an East facing walkout on the same level as the garage 100' away.<br>
                At least the top 3 courses of cinderblock are fire damaged.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The South edge of the basement is only 2'from the well head and only 6-8' from the electrical service pole on the SW corner. The exit to the septic system is in SW corner of the basement.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">If I utilize the existing foundation, I may need to replace all of the cinder block.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Using the existing footprint, I cannot build an overhang on the South side of the house because well problems would require pump truck access.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The foundation is dug into rock - not cheap.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Here's some possibilities:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">-repair the cinder block and the existing footprint.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">-lay plastic pipe for a geothermal heating system, then fill in the basement.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">-build columns on the existing grade beam to support trusses and a large (40x40) platform to add design flexibility.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">-create a hidden space in the basement along the South edge of the existing basement, thus moving the south edge of the "house" above away from the well head.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I appreciate any thoughts you may have.<br>

                <font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I am new to this site, and to the patterns. I am anxious to connect with others interested or experienced in applying the concepts.</font>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">This June, I traveled 1500 miles by bus to attend a conference about thin shell concrete. The eclectic group has a common interest in ferrocement and some of the new concrete technologies. The conference was great, and the organizer lent me his copy of “The Pattern Language” to read on the long bus ride home. It was previously recommended within the group and I was anxious to read it. It had a profound influence on me.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Now I want to employ what I read.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">Some of my experimentation with thin shell concrete led me to hyparbolic paraboloids. There are a few architectural examples; one is in Venice Beach, Florida, and the other is by Catalano. After reading the patterns, I realize that these visually stunning (to me) structures may be unsuitable to live in or difficult to make comfortable. There are many patterns to reference which influenced me: (95) Building Complex; (106) Positive Outdoor Space; (107) Wings of Light; (116) Cascade of Roofs, and; (134) Zen View; (160) Building Edge, etc.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I decided to start over from scratch.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">My own circumstances are as follows:</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">I own a piece of Colorado mountain land and am excited to build a home.<br>
                I have a limited budget, but own the land and have many materials.<br>
                The former owner’s house burned down. Hence, a foundation, septic, and well are present.<br>
                A large garage still stands; to which I am installing electric service now.<br>
                The land is in heavily wooded terrain with scenic views in all directions.<br>
                The driveway is steep and long and runs uphill straight North.<br>
                The driveway loops around the building site.<br>
                The septic, well, and electric service are inside the driveway loop.<br>
                The garage is just outside the driveway loop.<br>
                The building site and garage spaces are along the North edge of the property.<br>
                The solar exposure is excellent and the climate is mild enough for good gardening.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">The first problem I wanted to toss out to this group relates to positioning the entry. I am worried because, the best access to the future house is from the North. There is room for visitor parking (4-5). There is no way to approach the future house from the South or West edges of the site. The East edge is a basement walkout level with the garage which is 100 feet to the East. I’m having a hard time deciding if the North entry is ok or if I need to find a way to enter from the East even though the entry would be at basement level.</font></p>
                <p><font size="2" color="#000000" face="Times Roman">What do you think?</font></p>
