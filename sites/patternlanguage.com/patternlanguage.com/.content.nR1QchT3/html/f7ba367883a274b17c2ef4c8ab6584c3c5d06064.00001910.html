          <p><font color="brown">Many people are visiting the site and some are becoming members. It was important to find out who they were and what they wanted from the team behind the site. In December, I took the list of e-mail addresses of those who joined and wrote letters. Many people answered. It was a wonderful experience. Inert e-mail addresses became real people living different lives and expressing different needs. The exchange began. What I would like to do here is give a picture of what emerged from the exchange.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Most of our members are in the USA but answers also came from Brazil, Japan, Slovenia, Germany, England, Ireland. Since the site is not even on the search engines yet, most members found the site through word of mouth.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">The most frequent request was help in creating a home space, either plans for a new house, or wishes to reshape the current one. The second most frequent request was from builders who have always liked The Pattern Language and want better ways of making it happen. Some have an abiding interest in aesthetics and the environment. (For this third group, we’ve posted a <a href="/sponsors/onesponsorsreason.htm">response</a> from one of our sponsors, Laura Creighton, when she was asked why she was funding the site.)</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Now, the hard work is meeting the requests from members. Our team here is small - a lot smaller than the mountain of work, so we’ll be taking it bit by bit. Here’s an outline of how the workplan looks right now.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">The Easy to Do. We got requests to post photos and bios of the team here. That’s easy and a few pictures were taken as we worked on a model. We got requests to post recommendations of books we have loved and used. That’s easy. We got requests to post more clearly the services people can get from our office and we are changing those <a href="/sitemap/version6.htm#services">services</a> to meet the requests.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">A Change in Priorities. The demand is for a sequence for the individual family home. It had not been at the top of our workplan but we need to change priorities. Also the pooling of information necessary to create a builder’s network is obviously more urgent.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Confirmation of Work plan. Bulletin Board. Language Builder. Sequences. Different site map and navigation. (A new <a href="/sitemap/version6.htm">text-only site map</a> was worked out and posted.) Complete Publications. Long list.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">Specific Queries. Some members wrote thoughtful letters about specific topics that could not be answered in a few minutes. Those letters are with us and many will be addressed in this column. A few from professionals have been already been posted in a new section. A significant <a href="/professionals/synchronicity2.htm">essay</a> on hierarchy and the nature of working through networks by a Cape Cod member, Dan Palanza, has been posted.</font></p>
          <p><font color="brown">It was a delightful experience to meet our membership holders and I’m looking forward to more exchanges. I would like to thank you again for your answers and your support.</font></p><br>
