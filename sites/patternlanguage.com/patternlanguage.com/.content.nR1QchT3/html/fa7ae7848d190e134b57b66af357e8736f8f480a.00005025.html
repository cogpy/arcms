The processes steer people towards the coupling of these two perspectives on every single decision. In more detail:</span></span>

          <li>We have clear goals expressed for making the whole better.</li>
          <li>Fairview people have agreed on these goals</li>
          <li>Every new project has to make something new and positive happen according to these goals.</li>
          <li>Every penny that is spent has to contribute</li>
          <li>Every project is judged, and given permission, according to the contribution it makes to the private place, and also to the immediate environment of the larger whole</li>
          <li>Families will be scrambling to be part of it, once they understand that they they will become wealthy of pocket and of spirit by contributing towards the public good.</li>
          <li><b>Every</b> project whether it is a $1,000 project or a $100,000 project -- has the obligation to contribute.</li>
          <li>Making that precise, and practical, is the beauty of the scheme!</li>
