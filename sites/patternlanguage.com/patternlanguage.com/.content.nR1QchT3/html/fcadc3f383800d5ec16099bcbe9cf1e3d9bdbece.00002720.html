                            <li>Now, given your choice of this outdoor terrace, where would you most naturally want to put the main room of your cottage, in relation to the terrace. Does it open to it directly. Do you know, by standing on the land, where you would like to have the room, and how its relation to the terrace works?
                              <p>If you can, can you decide roughly the size and shape of the room, and put stakes in the corners, so you can visualize the room, and the terrace together, what one sees from the room, lookign toward the terrace, and how big the room is, and what its orientation is? If you can, ask yourself these questions, and decide whatever you can. It is worth giving answers even if they are tentative. You can always change them later, but the more your know now, about your feeling regarding this room, the better your small house will become.</p>
