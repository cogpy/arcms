  <table>
    <tr>
      <td width="700">
        <span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66"><span style="font-size:110%">During the 20th century there was a growing misunderstanding and confusion, about individual rights and public rights. This misunderstanding came about because of the onset of the process we now call "development": The process whereby land is bought and sold, with the aim of making monetary profit from the construction of speculative buildings on that land.</span></span>
        <p><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66"></span></p>
        <blockquote>
          <span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66"><span style="font-size:90%">The United States constitution provides property rights to landowners. As drafted by the framers of the constitution, these property rights were written and codified in law, in order to make sure that individual citizens and individual small businesses, could do what they considered necessary on their own land, to take care of families, food, and health: and to provide the means of livelihood.</span></span>
          <p><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66">The constitution was written to protect these small individuals, because there was a need to make sure that neither government, nor powerful nearby landowners, could deprive the individual of the liberty and opportunity needed to take care of family and business in this fashion.</span></p>
          <p><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66">During the 19th century, this simple idea was gradually eroded, because the concept of private property was extended to a new kind of individual -- the developer -- and to corporations. Both corporations and developers began to claim the protection that wqas originally provided, by the constitution, to private families and small `businesses. They claimed that they, too, had rights which needed to be protected. Since, at the time, this seemed reasonable, the extesion of property rights to protect corporations and developers occurred, largely without opposition, through a series of actions, finally memorialized in a landmark decision about 1880, (xxx v. xxx&gt; and by law following that decision.</span></p>
          <p><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66">But what people had not foreseen, was that the corporations and developers did not have the same natural instinct to care for the public good in the areas where they lived and worked. Gradually, the developers claimed these rights in such a way as to rape the land, abuse the public good, and -- in an atmosphere where they worked almost entirely according to the twin principles of profit and greed -- created the widespread ugliness we now know as sprawl.</span></p>
          <p><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66">Amazingly, the process was so subtle, that hardly anyone noticed the extraordinary abuse of the constitution that had taken place. The natural curbs on individual families and small businesses which made them equally want to protect the communities where they lived, did not occur in the case of developers and corporations. Without constraint they destroyed the American landscape, and continue to do so to this day, still sheltering under laws and principles which were self-policing in the private context for which they had originally been framed.</span></p>
          <p><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66">During the second half of the 20th century, planning departments all over the United States began to try to use their instruments of zoning law, to control developers, and hold them to some decent standard of public good. These efforts were not effective.</span></p>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66">First, they were not able to create the equivalent of conscience or a natural desire among developers to contribute to the public good.</span></li>
            <li><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66">Second, under the principle that there was no difference between private households and developers, the laws applied to control developers, began to create obnoxious and arduous conditions for genuinely private landowners, making it difficult and sometimes impossible for them to take care of their immediate surroundings in an` appropriate fashion.</span></li>
            <li><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66">The punitive application of badly formed laws, backfired, because even when benign developers tried to do good things, these laws, and their punitive application, made it all but impossible for them to succeed.</span></li>
          </ul><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66"><span style="background-color:cc0000;font-size:120%">All this happened because of the badly conceived idea that planning law could fix the problem. Of course it could not, because it was not a planning issue in the first place, but a constitutional issue.</span></span>
          <p><span class="h4class" style="color:ffcc66"><span style="font-size:80%">By giving developers and development corporations the status of private individuals, the law <i>first</i> set in motion a massive process of causing nearly irretrievable damage to the land all over the United States through speculative sprawl: and the attempt to control the monster that had been let loose by means of draconian planning law, <i>then</i> caused creation of laws which drastically reduced and abridged the property rights of individuals, by applying control intended for potentially irresponsible developers, to private individuals who are merely trying to take care of their own families, their own businesses, and their own communities.</span></span></p>
